Shares of all the major oil companies are soaring in early afternoon trading Thursday -- and it's not hard to see why.
As of 12:20 p.m. EST, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) stock is up 4.6% and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is higher by 5.5%. Smaller -- but still large-cap -- EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) is doing best of all, with a 9.5% gain.

Why are they up? At the most basic level, because each of these three companies produces and sells oil, and oil prices just moved sharply higher. According to the latest data from OilPrice.com, a barrel of WTI crude oil costs 5.4% more today than it did yesterday, while Brent crude (the international standard) is up 5.3%.  
Two factors lie behind the sudden spike in oil prices. First, Houthi rebels in Yemen announced this morning that they successfully attacked a Saudi Aramco oil production facility in Saudi Arabia. The missile attack on the facility in Jeddah has investors worried that Saudi oil production might be interrupted by the strike -- and that more attacks may mean more disruptions, because the Houthis apparently promised that "operations [against Saudi oil facilities] will continue."  
Adding to investor worries, Bloomberg reported this morning that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied oil producers including Russia have just agreed to hold April production levels steady at their current level of 7.2 million barrels per day, rather than increasing production as had been anticipated.  
Of the two stories, I think the second is the more important for investors to focus on. Currently, Saudi Arabia is operating under a "1 million barrel-a-day voluntary production cut," reports Bloomberg. This means that, even if attacks on Saudi facilities were to decrease the country's production capacity, they would have to slow production by more than 1 million barrels per day to take up all the slack that Saudi Aramco is already providing.
Simply put, attacks on Saudi Arabia can't have an effect upon oil supply unless Saudi Arabia wants them to -- and for now at least, it doesn't.
Longer-term, that could change. After all, with economies around the world starting to open up again as vaccinations against COVID-19 roll out, demand for oil is rising. The longer oil supply is held in check, in an environment of rising demand, the higher prices will rise -- and the better the news for Exxon's, Conoco's, and EOG's profits.

Despite ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) loss of more than $20 billion in 2020, CEO Darren Woods has promised investors that the energy giant remains committed to paying out a "very strong dividend."
Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday morning, Woods said Exxon chose to cut costs and dramatically reduce its capital spending to preserve the shareholder payout.

Exxon was something of an anomaly in the oil and gas industry last year, being one of the few companies that refused to suspend or even cut its dividend. BP (NYSE:BP), Eni (NYSE:E), and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A)(NYSE:RDS.B) all slashed their payouts, with Shell's being the first dividend cut in 70 years.
Exxon, though, did not raise its payout for the first time in years.
The CNBC interview with Woods follows Exxon's investor day presentation the day before, in which the company laid out its plans to cut debt, increase investments in capital projects that offer the potential for high returns, and keep production stable.
By reducing costs and improving margins, Exxon believes it will be able to increase its cash flows, which will allow it to further increase its dividend, currently yielding 6.2% annually.
The oil company is also trying to show that it buys into the climate change argument by appointing new directors to its board, including a climate activist. 
Woods told Squawk Box, "We were looking for people that have experience and a successful track record in allocating capital, finding value and opportunities, and helping businesses transition," and he believes the new board appointments will achieve that.
Exxon also intends to spend upward of $3 billion through 2025 on low-carbon projects.
