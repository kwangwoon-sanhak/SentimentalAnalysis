ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been playing their own game of thrones in recent years. One of these stocks holds the largest market cap on the stock market, followed by the other, since 2011. It's an epic battle to stir the blood and quicken the pulse -- if you keep an eye on such market metrics, at least.

But things have changed. Coming up from behind, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has claimed the second place in the market-cap race, pushing Exxon down to the third spot. Exxon remains the largest market cap on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) because neither Apple nor Google belong to that exclusive index, but now it's only the third most valuable business on the stock market.

So what's behind this shift at the top? A couple of things.
Google shares went through some hard times in recent years, trading behind the Dow between 2010 and 2013. Not for a lack of business performance, mind you, but investors kept compressing Google's valuation multiples for several reasons.

For one, Apple always played the more profitable hand in the mobile wars, leaving Google and its Android platform the lion's share of sales but only table scraps of profit. This is how Apple claimed the very top spot in the market cap marathon, and a key reason why Google didn't join the cap leaders.
Moreover, Google skeptics take a dim view of the company's business model in general. The barriers to entry in online search and advertising seem vanishingly low; surely, Google must be ripe for replacement by the next hungry upstart with a better idea?
But as it turns out (and don't call me Shirley), Google isn't exactly resting on its laurels. Big G's own research keeps the eponymous search engine relevant despite the best efforts of technology leaders and upstarts alike to topple the apple cart. Google's advertising machine has no equal so far.
And when serious threats do materialize, Google isn't afraid to haul out the wallet and buy its way to online dominance. YouTube is a classic case study of this strategy, and the $3.2 billion Nest Labs buyout shows that Google remains committed to protecting its future by any means necessary.
In 2013, Google investors started giving the stock some credit for this long-term vision, and the rest is market history. Google shares have gained 52% over the last 12 months while the Dow only climbed 13% higher.
Of course, Exxon has underperformed the Dow recently, with only breakeven returns over the last year. Oil prices have slowed down their once-unstoppable skyward climb, and the developed world is starting to get comfortable with the idea of using less black gold.

Fellow Fool Travis Hoium calls Exxon one of the worst Dow stocks for 2014, suggesting that the oil giant may not be involved in that old race with Apple for the foreseeable future.
With Google on an undeniable upward trajectory and Exxon slowly fading, it's time to get used to technology stocks ruling the market again. And neither one of the top two stocks is likely to join the Dow anytime soon.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
After finishing last week with a bang, as the major indexes all moved higher on Friday and managed to close the week in the black, the stock market is seeing a slight reversal today. As of 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is down 20 points, or 0.13% and the S&P 500 is off by 0.05%, while the Nasdaq is actually higher by 0.28%. With no major economic reports released this morning, the moves are likely the result of earnings reports still rolling in and investors looking toward the future.
Within the Dow, we have a number of big movers and shakers today. Two of the top performers are Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), which are up 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. Disney's move higher comes on little news other than another great example of the company's strength. This past weekend Warner Bros.' The Lego Movie brought in $69 million in its first weekend of domestic release. While that is the second highest opening weekend of all time in February, it is far below the $110 million Disney's Frozen collected on its first weekend. Ths is just a great example of Disney's business strength, and that's not even mentioning the company's ability to turn those movie viewers into consumers in other segments after the film is over.  
Meanwhile, American Express received an upgrade from Morgan Stanley this morning. The rating change from equal weight to overweight and the new 12-month price target of $100 per share has given investors the confidence to push the price higher today. The main reason given for the increase was AmEx's OptBlue program which Morgan Stanley feels will drive growth over the next few quarters.  
Two of the big Dow losers today are Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), as shares are both down about 1%. With the economic slowdown in emerging markets and places like China, investors are growing increasingly concerned about the need for big machinery and infrastructure building equipment, which is certainly one reason Caterpillar is falling again today and has lagged the market by more than 19% over the last 52-weeks.
The same could be said for ExxonMobil. Slowing economies mean demand for oil and gas is slowing, and getting to those energy resources is also becoming more expensive. We saw costs rise for all the major oil and gas players this past quarter, and that is not something likely to decline in the near future.
Looking for the next BIG thing, then look no further
