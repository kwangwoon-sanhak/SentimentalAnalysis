Following those remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Andy and Jack will take your questions on broader themes, including market dynamics and the recovery, the corporation's response, our financial and strategic priorities, progress on our drive for efficiencies and updates on major projects. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight developments since the second quarter of this year on the next slide.
In the Upstream, liquids realizations increased by approximately 75%, with demand and prices recovering from the lows encountered in the second quarter. This more than offset lower gas realizations. As market conditions improve, all economic curtailments were brought back online by the end of the quarter. However, government-mandated curtailments continued through the quarter.
Despite the considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, we have been able to achieve our best-ever safety and best reliability performance in the Upstream in five years. We continue to progress industry advantage developments in Guyana with the FID of Payara. In addition, we announced two new discoveries on the Stabroek Block, Yellowtail and Redtail, marking our 17th and 18th discoveries in Guyana. In the Downstream, we achieved the best reliability and safety performance in the last 10 years.
Unfortunately, industry refining margins fell to record lows, reflecting continued excess industry capacity and high levels of product inventory. Bottom-of-cycle conditions persist in the Chemical business, with margins falling from the second quarter, primarily impacted by higher feedstock costs. Demand remained resilient, with continued strength in the packaging and hygiene segments and recovery in the automotive and construction sectors. Across the corporation, we reduced capex by over $1 billion from the second quarter, making further progress toward our 30% reduction target.
During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to annually purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel for five years starting in 2022. We also expanded a joint agreement with Global Thermostat to advance and scale direct air capture technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of third quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of third-quarter results relative to the second quarter.
Starting with the second quarter, the reported loss of $1.1 billion included favorable identified items of $1.9 billion, driven by the noncash inventory adjustments we noted in the second quarter. Excluding these items, the second quarter was a loss of $3 billion. Third-quarter results were a loss of $700 million, including a $100 million noncash benefit from inventory valuation. Excluding identified items, there was an $800 million loss in the third quarter, a $2.2 billion improvement from the second quarter.
Significant improvement in Upstream liquids price was partially offset by lower gas realizations as well as lower refining margins. Higher volumes across all three of our businesses increased earnings by $700 million as demand continued to recover from the unprecedented levels seen in the second quarter. Finally, lower operating expenses improved earnings by an additional $200 million compared to the second quarter. It's worth noting that the benefit of opex savings delivered by our organization increased earnings by $1 billion versus the third quarter of 2019.
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of results for each business. Note that the earnings comments are excluding identified items. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher liquids prices, partially offset by lower gas realizations mainly due to a lag in crude index LNG contract pricing. Volume impacts, including the recovery of economic curtailments, increased earnings by $140 million.
Lower expenses, including the benefits of captured structural efficiencies, improved earnings by another $110 million. Moving to Slide 6 is a comparison of third-quarter 2020 results relative to third-quarter 2019. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $2.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019, reflecting the current price environment. The unfavorable volume impact was driven by curtailments and divestments.
Lower production and exploration expenses were offset by unfavorable onetime tax items. On Slide 7, Upstream volumes increased by 34,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the second quarter. With the challenging market conditions, we curtailed production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April. By the end of September, those volumes were back online.
Government-mandated reductions were implemented in May and continued through the third quarter. Those curtailments averaged 140,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite the environment, we achieved growth of 50,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, primarily in the Permian. Scheduled maintenance in a third-party diluent supply outage at Kearl decreased volumes by 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.
Decline was partially offset by higher entitlements. Moving to Slide 8. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 230,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Volumes were lower due to curtailments mentioned on the prior slide as well as the divestment of our Norway nonoperated assets at the end of 2019.
Despite the current business environment, we saw continued liquids growth from Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana. Moving to the Downstream on Slide 9. Earnings increased by approximately $380 million relative to the second quarter. Margin increased by $70 million.
Despite record low industry margins, which decreased earnings by $470 million, favorable trading, supply chain impacts and marketing margins more than offset these impacts. Demand recovery, primarily in road raw transportation fuels and on lubricants, increased earnings by $300 million. We spared about 25% of refining capacity in the third quarter. Reduced expenses, including savings from maintenance and turnaround efficiencies and fewer contractors, increased earnings by $60 million.
Moving to the next slide. I will discuss Downstream results relative to the third-quarter 2019. Earnings decreased approximately $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the low industry margin environment I just discussed. This was partially offset by $400 million of favorable trading, optimization and marketing margins.
Lower volumes associated with COVID-19 demand destruction decreased earnings by $80 million. We continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies, which improved earnings by $360 million. On Slide 11, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings increased by almost $200 million from the second quarter.
Lower margins reduced earnings by $80 million, reflecting higher feedstock costs. Strong reliability, coupled with improved demand, resulted in higher volumes which increased earnings by $220 million. It is worth noting in the third quarter, polyethylene sales were a record high. This also highlights our strong reliability in the quarter.
We continue to capture market and supply chain efficiencies. Reduced expenses, including reduced contracted utilization and activity pacing improved earnings by $40 million. Turning to Slide 12. Chemical earnings increased by more than $300 million relative to the third quarter of 2019.
Earnings improved due to higher margins from lower feed costs and higher sales volumes. We also benefited from our cost reduction efforts, which improved earnings by $170 million in the quarter. The next slide provides an update on the progress we made reducing our costs. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15%.
Through the third quarter, we are on track to exceed the reduction target, delivering additional cost savings. Cash operating costs are approximately 20% lower versus the third quarter of 2019 and are down almost 15% relative to the first quarter of this year. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower logistics and supply chain costs. The reorganization of our businesses along value chains has been critical in identifying and delivering these improvements.
Importantly, we have realized these savings while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. Now moving on to capital spend on Slide 14. Third quarter capital spending was down more than 20% versus the second quarter. Reductions continue to be driven by pacing of short-cycle unconventional investment.
In the third quarter, we also reduced Downstream project spend as we ramped down activity. Importantly, our corporate project organization in collaboration with our contractors have managed to more than offset the cost of deferral, preserving the overall value of the projects. Jack will share some additional details later in the call on this. Let's turn to the next page where you can see the impact of these activities on our cash profile.
Third quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, with higher crude prices, increased volumes and the benefits of opex savings. We also saw a benefit from working capital with lower product inventory. Gross debt decreased by about $700 million to $68.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash.
Turning to Slide 16. I will cover a few key considerations for the fourth quarter. In the Upstream, production is expected to remain in line with the third quarter. The announced government-mandated production curtailments are expected to average 220,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, an increase of approximately 80,000 oil equivalent barrels from the third quarter.
The impacts of increased curtailments are anticipated to be offset by seasonally higher European gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand to be roughly in line with the third quarter with higher scheduled maintenance. In Chemical, we anticipate margins to be impacted by increased supply from capacity additions and improved industry utilization with the recovery from hurricanes and reliability events. Our scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter.
Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $900 million. Capital spending is expected to be higher than the third quarter with onetime milestone project payments. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Thank you, Stephen. First and foremost, we hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As we've discussed on previous calls, the challenges presented by COVID-19 are unlike anything the industry has ever seen, as is the response of our employees and contractors. They have gone to great lengths to safely maintain operations, manufacture and deliver the products society needs for sanitation and hygiene, as well as provide the fuels that ensure these and other critical supplies get to the places they are needed.
They have responded to unprecedented market conditions with all three of our businesses at or significantly below bottom-of-cycle conditions. We could not be more proud of the exceptional efforts and response of our workforce. We are navigating this near-term uncertainty by achieving record safety and reliability performance, delivering better-than-expected cash savings that are on pace to exceed our 2020 opex and capex targets while maintaining operations integrity, and pacing projects to preserve long-term value and position us for the eventual recovery. This slide shows the demand impact of the pandemic, the corresponding industry response and third-party projections for the market recovery after the second-quarter lows.
Crude and product inventories rose to a peak in June as the reduction in demand outpaced supply cuts. In the third quarter, inventories have started to fall as demand recovers and exceeds current supply levels. Third-party estimates suggest liquids inventory decreased by about 200 million barrels in the third quarter, and they expect demand to return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. Of course, the demand projections shown here lead to a few critical questions.
How will the supply respond? What will be the resulting supply and demand balance? And what price is required to achieve this? In light of this, it is worth looking at the fundamentals. Let's start with the next slide with Upstream supply. In the Upstream, which is a depletion business, capital investment is required to add supply to offset ongoing decline. This chart shows an obvious but sometimes overlooked relationship.
Industry investment levels rise and fall with price, or more specifically, the industry's level of revenue. Low price environments lead to low investment levels and, therefore, less new supply to offset depletion. Eventually, available supply declines, leading to a tight supply and demand balance and higher prices. Over the past five years, we have seen a steady decline in conventional spending, which has been somewhat offset by North American unconventional growth.
Pre-pandemic, the industry was already investing at levels below historic rates and below what would be required to meet future demand and overcome natural depletion, all of this based on recent estimates from the International Energy Agency. The overall impact of the pandemic this year has been dramatic, significantly reducing current investment levels, which exacerbates the problem. On top of this, industry exploration continues at multi-decade lows. Meanwhile, underlying production decline of 5% to 6% per year continues relentlessly.
Looking forward, if the industry is to meet credible third-party estimates for energy demand, we will need to significantly increase investments. This is shown here with a range of third-party estimates for the required level of future investments. For the industry to fund this level of investments, prices will have to rise. With that, I now turn it over to Jack.
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Thanks, Andy. Moving to Slide 22. I'm going to extend the point Andy just made on crude prices to refining and Chemical margins. This chart puts the current refining and Chemical margins into the context of the last 20 years.
Refining is a highly cyclical industry with significant ups and downs. But today's net refining margins are below any low experienced in the prior 20 years. Demand for diesel and gasoline has recovered much faster than jet, which is still 45% below pre-COVID levels. The large differences in the demand recovery for the different transportation fuels put significant pressure on refinery operations, with excess jet production having to be blended into other products, which has driven second quarter and third quarter net refinery margins negative and to record low levels.
Chemical margins are also close to the bottom-of-cycle conditions. Although chemical demand has remained strong, particularly in the packaging and medical markets, the excess supply from major investments on the Gulf Coast and Asia continues to pressure margins. Industry is responding by shutting down capacity in refining and pushing out new investments in chemicals. This is a typical response we have seen historically as producers struggle to maintain operations in very challenging financial conditions.
We expect this will continue until supply and demand come into balance and margins recover. So in summary, we see a recovery on the horizon across each of our businesses. We believe it is less a matter of if, but more a matter of when. This uncertainty led to actions we've taken this year, which underpins our plans for 2021.
As was mentioned on this call last quarter, we acted quickly and decisively earlier this year to the challenging economic environment, while retaining flexibility and positioning the business for the recovery that will inevitably come. Looking to 2021, we're focused on continuing this year's progress. Despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID, our operations are delivering world-class performance. Our safety and the reliability of our operations have been at or close to record levels in all three of our businesses.
We're committed to maintaining this performance in 2021. In terms of cash opex, in April, we gave the organization a target to reduce operating expenses for the year by 15%. We're well on our way to delivering even larger reductions and will achieve further structural efficiencies next year. We reduced this year's capex plan by 30% to $23 billion, and similar to opex, expect to finish the year below our reduction target.
To achieve this, we took steps to delay or postpone projects in construction. We challenged our organization and partners to offset any value impact from these delays with additional execution efficiencies, and our project teams delivered. In 2021, we expect to drive capex lower than this year to between $16 billion and $19 billion. Portfolio high-grading activities are continuing.
While current conditions are challenging, we're making progress and anticipate additional assets in the market over the next 12 months. And finally, there'll be no change to our capital allocation priorities of investing in industry-advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The progress we've made this year gives us confidence as we head into 2021. The work done over the last couple of years to improve our organization and drive efficiencies paid off in responding to the pandemic.
Let me cover this in a little more detail. A critical change has been the move from an organization focused on our functions to an organization aligned along the value chains of our businesses. This reduced the senior leadership structure and associated overhead, while improving line of sight across the business and increasing efforts to drive higher value from our assets. The new organization is also giving us the opportunity for deeper structural efficiencies, which we began working on in the second half of last year.
As the pandemic hit, we were well positioned to accelerate the implementation of these efficiencies in response to the significant deterioration of economic conditions. The structural changes include a significant reduction in the size of our workforce, driven by increasing spans of control, high-grading activities, accelerating the use of digital technologies and leveraging the lower activity levels. These workforce reductions have been developed on a country-by-country, business-by-business basis. As you're likely aware, we've recently made announcements in Australia, Europe and then here in the U.S.
this week. Overall, we anticipate a reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, of 15% by year-end 2022 versus 2019 staffing levels. The vast majority of these reductions are occurring in above-field or above-site organizations. Our operating organizations are driving further cost reductions in areas such as maintenance and logistics and supply chain, while continuing their focus on delivering world-class safety, reliability and environmental performance.
Our global projects organization formed last year continues to build on our industry-leading project execution competency. This organization is focused on prioritizing our project portfolio to maximize value while capturing efficiencies in the current market. A single corporate organization for project execution has been critical in leveraging the scale of the corporation's investments, and effectively working with the contractor community, our partners and host governments to efficiently reduce spend while preserving optionality and long-term value. Our projects organization is managing the industry's most attractive portfolio of projects.
We continue to aggressively advance our highest value projects and maintain exploration activities in both Guyana and Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the more favorable cost environment to progress the Corpus Christi chemical project and deliver it ahead of schedule and underbudget. We're efficiently pacing short-cycle Permian developments and working with our partners to defer other Downstream, Chemical and LNG projects. Importantly, we are not canceling any projects that are in execution or in the funding process.
These remain attractive investments. And while the value of these projects may be deferred, it will not be diminished. Let me now turn to our progress in Guyana. With the announcement of two discoveries on the Stabroek blocks during the quarter at Yellowtail-2 and Redtail-2, the recoverable resource estimate is now approaching nine billion oil equivalent barrels, positioning it as the largest new conventional liquids play in the last decade.
The Liza-2 project remains on schedule for a 2022 start-up, the FPSO is under construction in Singapore and the first offshore installation campaign is under way. Also in the quarter, we sanctioned the Payara project, our third major deepwater development on the Stabroek block. We anticipate first production in 2024 and will have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and a resource base of 600 million barrels of oil. The FPSO construction will follow Liza-2, utilizing many of the same contractors and fabrication yards.
And we're building out the in-country community required to be successful over the long term. In total, there are now more than 2,000 Guyanese citizens supporting the project activities and more than 2,500 Guyanese companies registered with the project's Centre for Local Business Development that is focused on building local business capacity. Turning to the Permian. Our focus in the Permian is on preserving value as we continue to pace our activity levels.
We expect Permian production to total about 360,000 oil equivalent barrels per day this year, which is about one-third higher than last year and consistent with our plan, despite a more than 35% reduction in capex spend and a 14,000 barrel per day year-to-date reduction due to COVID-related economic curtailments. Our teams have done an exceptional job in driving down drilling and completion costs through improved performance and productivity. We're currently operating about 15 rigs as we head into next year, and we expect further reductions stabilizing at around 10 to 12 rigs. We will obviously keep a close eye on the market and make necessary adjustments as the environment evolves.
At this time, our expectation is that our development activity level will hold fairly steady in 2021. With current plans, next year's production is expected to average approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. At this time, I'll hand the call back over to Andy to talk about our portfolio prioritization.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Thanks. As Jack just highlighted, we have an attractive set of investment opportunities that is continuing to grow. With the constraints brought on by the pandemic, we are actively managing this portfolio of investments with a focus on advancing our highest-value projects. As our opportunity set grows and conditions evolve, we continue to reassess our investment portfolio and prioritize our spend.
Each project must remain advantaged versus industry and competitive with our other opportunities. We work to ensure our assets remain a good strategic fit, provide material growth potential and ultimately create differentiating value. This is a continuous process and an essential element of our annual planning process. It is particularly important this year as we work to develop plans within the constraints brought on by the pandemic.
With the challenging price environment and our current debt levels, added emphasis is being placed on evaluating our entire portfolio for the potential of additional asset divestments. While continuing to progress our previously announced divestment program of $15 billion, we may expand it through a reevaluation of our North American dry gas assets, which are currently included in the corporation's long-term development plan. More specifically, we are evaluating the opportunity to bring the value of some of these assets forward by removing them from the development plan and marketing them through our divestment program. In total, the assets under consideration have carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion, which could be at risk for impairment depending on the candidates for divestment and the current estimate of their market value.
We expect to complete the review as part of our plan process, which will be finalized with the Board in November and will be shared with all of you as part of future earnings calls and at our analyst meeting early next year. Given the importance of the current market conditions on our plans and decisions, I'd like to return to the price and margin environment and the earnings potential of the corporation. Historically, our three businesses, each significant in the industry, are typically at different points in their business cycles which helps mitigate the impacts of their down cycles. In this unprecedented environment, all three businesses are simultaneously experiencing prices and margins below the 10-year range, significantly impacting the corporation's earnings.
We see the impact in the broader industry, with mounting losses, reduced investments and increased closures. And while questions remain around future demand recovery, one thing is certain: Current conditions cannot continue. Supply and demand will eventually meet. Prices and margins will respond.
This suggests there is much more margin and price upside than downside going forward, and therefore, an expected increase in earnings. For perspective, the earnings range over the prior 10-year period has been between $2 billion and $8 billion per year in the Downstream and between $1 billion and $5 billion per year in Chemical, a far cry from where we are today. And while we may not see a return to average earnings in the near term, we should at least move to the bottom end of the historic range, which we see as the minimum levels demonstrated by a decade of industry experience. This is the basis upon which we are building next year's plan.
If we see a recovery just to the bottom of the 10-year range and a Brent crude price in the range of credible third-party estimates, we will be able to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt flat with second-quarter levels. This morning, we've given you an overview of how we are navigating the challenging near-term market environment and discussed how market forces will restore supply and demand balances and improve the price and margin environment. The longer-term fundamentals remain robust. Economies will recover.
People's lives will improve, and the demand for energy will grow. In the short term, you've seen adjustments in our capital allocation. But our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable and growing dividend. We're developing a 2021 plan consistent with the uncertainties and in line with the simultaneous low margins and prices in each of our businesses.
Our capex will be further reduced to the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. We're further reducing our cash operating expense with a focus on overhead. We are looking to increase divestments and working to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt at second-quarter levels. Of course, we all recognize the uncertainty in today's market.
We are keeping a close eye on developments and, importantly, are maintaining the flexibility to respond as conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Before we open up the lines for your questions, I want to reemphasize that we're pleased with the operational performance we've achieved. We're on track to better the spending targets we established earlier this year, and we're positioning our portfolio for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back to Stephen to begin our Q&A session.
Stephen Littleton -- Vice president of Investor Relations and Secretary
Thank you for your comments, Jack and Andy. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions.
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Swiger and Mr. Williams.
[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Margolin -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
So on the capital program, you guys, basically already gave us a hint as to sort of the categories that you're committed to at close to pre-COVID levels and the ones that you see the most opportunity to stay back. So I guess I'll just focus my first question on the Permian. How much capital reduction in 2021 was already built-in because you've completed a lot of your facilities and infrastructure spends by that point? And then, how much do you think is the reduction in activity from what was planned before the crisis? Thank you.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks for the question, Sam. I mentioned earlier, we're at 15 rigs now, going down to about 10, and we think 10 to 12 rigs will be where we're going to be in '21. Of course, with an eye toward what the market does.
That's substantially down from our earlier plans, where we were planning to continue to, more or less, stay at a rig level in the kind of 50 rig, 50 to 60 rig level in the Permian. Growth is substantially down. But look, I just want to just reinforce that the decision to reduce the spin due to the cash flow constraints is not at all a reflection of our development results, it's quite to the contrary. We're very pleased with how things are going.
I mentioned the efficiency improvement that we've seen. We're continuing to gain experience with the cube developments and confirming those are a lot of value in that approach.So, we're very confident in the quality of the resource, including the unique development plan we have in the Delaware Basin, and then also the logistics integration we had at the Gulf Coast. So, we really like what we're seeing out there. We're just going to curtail activity because we have the discretion to do so and defer and move some of that capital to other opportunities.
Sam Margolin -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
And I think I have a follow-up, and I think it's for Andy, and it's about asset sales. A lot of your businesses are organized in JVs and equity affiliates and from the perspective of a Stock Analyst that usually doesn't mean anything. But right now, the dividend at Exxon's level is stressed, just given the environment. And that's a problem because it doesn't always align with the capital priorities of affiliates.
So, instead of thinking about disposals by asset category or segment, does it make sense to think about them from the perspective of asset class and maybe affiliate positions? And JVs are a logical place to look for disposals, because at the very least, you sort of align production with your cash, your uses of cash priorities?
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Sam, thanks for the question. Our review for divestment candidates is quite comprehensive and it looks across every sort of different way you can cut the business. In terms of what we think is no longer a strategic fit, it's all the criteria for divestment, regardless of whether it's in a JV, an equity company, or a more conventional type of arrangements there.So, as we go through this and it's a process of continual renewal and review, we don't really find this sort of categories that you have suggested as being, as representing any sort of a barrier to analysis. There may be some friction depending on agreements in some of these arrangements and so forth, but by and large with how it's existed, we've worked with the operator or the other partners to reach a resolution and be able to put the right assets into the market at the right time.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Good morning, Devin.
Operator
Devin, your line might be muted. OK. We'll move on to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan.
Phil Gresh -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Andy, I want to come back to Slide 29 where you were talking about the dividend coverage potential in 2021. If I look at the oil price, you're implying for the third quarter, being at the low end of historic range around $40 oil, and then you assumed recovery in refining margins there. I think the 2021 would imply the $2 billion of the $2.8 billion recovery there to get back to the low end, if I understood that correctly. So, I guess, are you trying to imply that you think you can, if you get a little bit of recovery in refining, that you can cover your dividend in the low 40s organically?

Following those remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Andy and Jack will take your questions on broader themes, including market dynamics and the recovery, the corporation's response, our financial and strategic priorities, progress on our drive for efficiencies and updates on major projects. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight developments since the second quarter of this year on the next slide.
In the Upstream, liquids realizations increased by approximately 75%, with demand and prices recovering from the lows encountered in the second quarter. This more than offset lower gas realizations. As market conditions improve, all economic curtailments were brought back online by the end of the quarter. However, government-mandated curtailments continued through the quarter.
Despite the considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, we have been able to achieve our best-ever safety and best reliability performance in the Upstream in five years. We continue to progress industry advantage developments in Guyana with the FID of Payara. In addition, we announced two new discoveries on the Stabroek Block, Yellowtail and Redtail, marking our 17th and 18th discoveries in Guyana. In the Downstream, we achieved the best reliability and safety performance in the last 10 years.
Unfortunately, industry refining margins fell to record lows, reflecting continued excess industry capacity and high levels of product inventory. Bottom-of-cycle conditions persist in the Chemical business, with margins falling from the second quarter, primarily impacted by higher feedstock costs. Demand remained resilient, with continued strength in the packaging and hygiene segments and recovery in the automotive and construction sectors. Across the corporation, we reduced capex by over $1 billion from the second quarter, making further progress toward our 30% reduction target.
During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to annually purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel for five years starting in 2022. We also expanded a joint agreement with Global Thermostat to advance and scale direct air capture technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of third quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of third-quarter results relative to the second quarter.
Starting with the second quarter, the reported loss of $1.1 billion included favorable identified items of $1.9 billion, driven by the noncash inventory adjustments we noted in the second quarter. Excluding these items, the second quarter was a loss of $3 billion. Third-quarter results were a loss of $700 million, including a $100 million noncash benefit from inventory valuation. Excluding identified items, there was an $800 million loss in the third quarter, a $2.2 billion improvement from the second quarter.
Significant improvement in Upstream liquids price was partially offset by lower gas realizations as well as lower refining margins. Higher volumes across all three of our businesses increased earnings by $700 million as demand continued to recover from the unprecedented levels seen in the second quarter. Finally, lower operating expenses improved earnings by an additional $200 million compared to the second quarter. It's worth noting that the benefit of opex savings delivered by our organization increased earnings by $1 billion versus the third quarter of 2019.
On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of results for each business. Note that the earnings comments are excluding identified items. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher liquids prices, partially offset by lower gas realizations mainly due to a lag in crude index LNG contract pricing. Volume impacts, including the recovery of economic curtailments, increased earnings by $140 million.
Lower expenses, including the benefits of captured structural efficiencies, improved earnings by another $110 million. Moving to Slide 6 is a comparison of third-quarter 2020 results relative to third-quarter 2019. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $2.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019, reflecting the current price environment. The unfavorable volume impact was driven by curtailments and divestments.
Lower production and exploration expenses were offset by unfavorable onetime tax items. On Slide 7, Upstream volumes increased by 34,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the second quarter. With the challenging market conditions, we curtailed production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April. By the end of September, those volumes were back online.
Government-mandated reductions were implemented in May and continued through the third quarter. Those curtailments averaged 140,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite the environment, we achieved growth of 50,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, primarily in the Permian. Scheduled maintenance in a third-party diluent supply outage at Kearl decreased volumes by 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.
Decline was partially offset by higher entitlements. Moving to Slide 8. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 230,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Volumes were lower due to curtailments mentioned on the prior slide as well as the divestment of our Norway nonoperated assets at the end of 2019.
Despite the current business environment, we saw continued liquids growth from Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana. Moving to the Downstream on Slide 9. Earnings increased by approximately $380 million relative to the second quarter. Margin increased by $70 million.
Despite record low industry margins, which decreased earnings by $470 million, favorable trading, supply chain impacts and marketing margins more than offset these impacts. Demand recovery, primarily in road raw transportation fuels and on lubricants, increased earnings by $300 million. We spared about 25% of refining capacity in the third quarter. Reduced expenses, including savings from maintenance and turnaround efficiencies and fewer contractors, increased earnings by $60 million.
Moving to the next slide. I will discuss Downstream results relative to the third-quarter 2019. Earnings decreased approximately $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the low industry margin environment I just discussed. This was partially offset by $400 million of favorable trading, optimization and marketing margins.
Lower volumes associated with COVID-19 demand destruction decreased earnings by $80 million. We continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies, which improved earnings by $360 million. On Slide 11, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings increased by almost $200 million from the second quarter.
Lower margins reduced earnings by $80 million, reflecting higher feedstock costs. Strong reliability, coupled with improved demand, resulted in higher volumes which increased earnings by $220 million. It is worth noting in the third quarter, polyethylene sales were a record high. This also highlights our strong reliability in the quarter.
We continue to capture market and supply chain efficiencies. Reduced expenses, including reduced contracted utilization and activity pacing improved earnings by $40 million. Turning to Slide 12. Chemical earnings increased by more than $300 million relative to the third quarter of 2019.
Earnings improved due to higher margins from lower feed costs and higher sales volumes. We also benefited from our cost reduction efforts, which improved earnings by $170 million in the quarter. The next slide provides an update on the progress we made reducing our costs. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15%.
Through the third quarter, we are on track to exceed the reduction target, delivering additional cost savings. Cash operating costs are approximately 20% lower versus the third quarter of 2019 and are down almost 15% relative to the first quarter of this year. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower logistics and supply chain costs. The reorganization of our businesses along value chains has been critical in identifying and delivering these improvements.
Importantly, we have realized these savings while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. Now moving on to capital spend on Slide 14. Third quarter capital spending was down more than 20% versus the second quarter. Reductions continue to be driven by pacing of short-cycle unconventional investment.
In the third quarter, we also reduced Downstream project spend as we ramped down activity. Importantly, our corporate project organization in collaboration with our contractors have managed to more than offset the cost of deferral, preserving the overall value of the projects. Jack will share some additional details later in the call on this. Let's turn to the next page where you can see the impact of these activities on our cash profile.
Third quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, with higher crude prices, increased volumes and the benefits of opex savings. We also saw a benefit from working capital with lower product inventory. Gross debt decreased by about $700 million to $68.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash.
Turning to Slide 16. I will cover a few key considerations for the fourth quarter. In the Upstream, production is expected to remain in line with the third quarter. The announced government-mandated production curtailments are expected to average 220,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, an increase of approximately 80,000 oil equivalent barrels from the third quarter.
The impacts of increased curtailments are anticipated to be offset by seasonally higher European gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand to be roughly in line with the third quarter with higher scheduled maintenance. In Chemical, we anticipate margins to be impacted by increased supply from capacity additions and improved industry utilization with the recovery from hurricanes and reliability events. Our scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter.
Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $900 million. Capital spending is expected to be higher than the third quarter with onetime milestone project payments. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Thank you, Stephen. First and foremost, we hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As we've discussed on previous calls, the challenges presented by COVID-19 are unlike anything the industry has ever seen, as is the response of our employees and contractors. They have gone to great lengths to safely maintain operations, manufacture and deliver the products society needs for sanitation and hygiene, as well as provide the fuels that ensure these and other critical supplies get to the places they are needed.
They have responded to unprecedented market conditions with all three of our businesses at or significantly below bottom-of-cycle conditions. We could not be more proud of the exceptional efforts and response of our workforce. We are navigating this near-term uncertainty by achieving record safety and reliability performance, delivering better-than-expected cash savings that are on pace to exceed our 2020 opex and capex targets while maintaining operations integrity, and pacing projects to preserve long-term value and position us for the eventual recovery. This slide shows the demand impact of the pandemic, the corresponding industry response and third-party projections for the market recovery after the second-quarter lows.
Crude and product inventories rose to a peak in June as the reduction in demand outpaced supply cuts. In the third quarter, inventories have started to fall as demand recovers and exceeds current supply levels. Third-party estimates suggest liquids inventory decreased by about 200 million barrels in the third quarter, and they expect demand to return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. Of course, the demand projections shown here lead to a few critical questions.
How will the supply respond? What will be the resulting supply and demand balance? And what price is required to achieve this? In light of this, it is worth looking at the fundamentals. Let's start with the next slide with Upstream supply. In the Upstream, which is a depletion business, capital investment is required to add supply to offset ongoing decline. This chart shows an obvious but sometimes overlooked relationship.
Industry investment levels rise and fall with price, or more specifically, the industry's level of revenue. Low price environments lead to low investment levels and, therefore, less new supply to offset depletion. Eventually, available supply declines, leading to a tight supply and demand balance and higher prices. Over the past five years, we have seen a steady decline in conventional spending, which has been somewhat offset by North American unconventional growth.
Pre-pandemic, the industry was already investing at levels below historic rates and below what would be required to meet future demand and overcome natural depletion, all of this based on recent estimates from the International Energy Agency. The overall impact of the pandemic this year has been dramatic, significantly reducing current investment levels, which exacerbates the problem. On top of this, industry exploration continues at multi-decade lows. Meanwhile, underlying production decline of 5% to 6% per year continues relentlessly.
Looking forward, if the industry is to meet credible third-party estimates for energy demand, we will need to significantly increase investments. This is shown here with a range of third-party estimates for the required level of future investments. For the industry to fund this level of investments, prices will have to rise. With that, I now turn it over to Jack.
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Thanks, Andy. Moving to Slide 22. I'm going to extend the point Andy just made on crude prices to refining and Chemical margins. This chart puts the current refining and Chemical margins into the context of the last 20 years.
Refining is a highly cyclical industry with significant ups and downs. But today's net refining margins are below any low experienced in the prior 20 years. Demand for diesel and gasoline has recovered much faster than jet, which is still 45% below pre-COVID levels. The large differences in the demand recovery for the different transportation fuels put significant pressure on refinery operations, with excess jet production having to be blended into other products, which has driven second quarter and third quarter net refinery margins negative and to record low levels.
Chemical margins are also close to the bottom-of-cycle conditions. Although chemical demand has remained strong, particularly in the packaging and medical markets, the excess supply from major investments on the Gulf Coast and Asia continues to pressure margins. Industry is responding by shutting down capacity in refining and pushing out new investments in chemicals. This is a typical response we have seen historically as producers struggle to maintain operations in very challenging financial conditions.
We expect this will continue until supply and demand come into balance and margins recover. So in summary, we see a recovery on the horizon across each of our businesses. We believe it is less a matter of if, but more a matter of when. This uncertainty led to actions we've taken this year, which underpins our plans for 2021.
As was mentioned on this call last quarter, we acted quickly and decisively earlier this year to the challenging economic environment, while retaining flexibility and positioning the business for the recovery that will inevitably come. Looking to 2021, we're focused on continuing this year's progress. Despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID, our operations are delivering world-class performance. Our safety and the reliability of our operations have been at or close to record levels in all three of our businesses.
We're committed to maintaining this performance in 2021. In terms of cash opex, in April, we gave the organization a target to reduce operating expenses for the year by 15%. We're well on our way to delivering even larger reductions and will achieve further structural efficiencies next year. We reduced this year's capex plan by 30% to $23 billion, and similar to opex, expect to finish the year below our reduction target.
To achieve this, we took steps to delay or postpone projects in construction. We challenged our organization and partners to offset any value impact from these delays with additional execution efficiencies, and our project teams delivered. In 2021, we expect to drive capex lower than this year to between $16 billion and $19 billion. Portfolio high-grading activities are continuing.
While current conditions are challenging, we're making progress and anticipate additional assets in the market over the next 12 months. And finally, there'll be no change to our capital allocation priorities of investing in industry-advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The progress we've made this year gives us confidence as we head into 2021. The work done over the last couple of years to improve our organization and drive efficiencies paid off in responding to the pandemic.
Let me cover this in a little more detail. A critical change has been the move from an organization focused on our functions to an organization aligned along the value chains of our businesses. This reduced the senior leadership structure and associated overhead, while improving line of sight across the business and increasing efforts to drive higher value from our assets. The new organization is also giving us the opportunity for deeper structural efficiencies, which we began working on in the second half of last year.
As the pandemic hit, we were well positioned to accelerate the implementation of these efficiencies in response to the significant deterioration of economic conditions. The structural changes include a significant reduction in the size of our workforce, driven by increasing spans of control, high-grading activities, accelerating the use of digital technologies and leveraging the lower activity levels. These workforce reductions have been developed on a country-by-country, business-by-business basis. As you're likely aware, we've recently made announcements in Australia, Europe and then here in the U.S.
this week. Overall, we anticipate a reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, of 15% by year-end 2022 versus 2019 staffing levels. The vast majority of these reductions are occurring in above-field or above-site organizations. Our operating organizations are driving further cost reductions in areas such as maintenance and logistics and supply chain, while continuing their focus on delivering world-class safety, reliability and environmental performance.
Our global projects organization formed last year continues to build on our industry-leading project execution competency. This organization is focused on prioritizing our project portfolio to maximize value while capturing efficiencies in the current market. A single corporate organization for project execution has been critical in leveraging the scale of the corporation's investments, and effectively working with the contractor community, our partners and host governments to efficiently reduce spend while preserving optionality and long-term value. Our projects organization is managing the industry's most attractive portfolio of projects.
We continue to aggressively advance our highest value projects and maintain exploration activities in both Guyana and Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the more favorable cost environment to progress the Corpus Christi chemical project and deliver it ahead of schedule and underbudget. We're efficiently pacing short-cycle Permian developments and working with our partners to defer other Downstream, Chemical and LNG projects. Importantly, we are not canceling any projects that are in execution or in the funding process.
These remain attractive investments. And while the value of these projects may be deferred, it will not be diminished. Let me now turn to our progress in Guyana. With the announcement of two discoveries on the Stabroek blocks during the quarter at Yellowtail-2 and Redtail-2, the recoverable resource estimate is now approaching nine billion oil equivalent barrels, positioning it as the largest new conventional liquids play in the last decade.
The Liza-2 project remains on schedule for a 2022 start-up, the FPSO is under construction in Singapore and the first offshore installation campaign is under way. Also in the quarter, we sanctioned the Payara project, our third major deepwater development on the Stabroek block. We anticipate first production in 2024 and will have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and a resource base of 600 million barrels of oil. The FPSO construction will follow Liza-2, utilizing many of the same contractors and fabrication yards.
And we're building out the in-country community required to be successful over the long term. In total, there are now more than 2,000 Guyanese citizens supporting the project activities and more than 2,500 Guyanese companies registered with the project's Centre for Local Business Development that is focused on building local business capacity. Turning to the Permian. Our focus in the Permian is on preserving value as we continue to pace our activity levels.
We expect Permian production to total about 360,000 oil equivalent barrels per day this year, which is about one-third higher than last year and consistent with our plan, despite a more than 35% reduction in capex spend and a 14,000 barrel per day year-to-date reduction due to COVID-related economic curtailments. Our teams have done an exceptional job in driving down drilling and completion costs through improved performance and productivity. We're currently operating about 15 rigs as we head into next year, and we expect further reductions stabilizing at around 10 to 12 rigs. We will obviously keep a close eye on the market and make necessary adjustments as the environment evolves.
At this time, our expectation is that our development activity level will hold fairly steady in 2021. With current plans, next year's production is expected to average approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. At this time, I'll hand the call back over to Andy to talk about our portfolio prioritization.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Thanks. As Jack just highlighted, we have an attractive set of investment opportunities that is continuing to grow. With the constraints brought on by the pandemic, we are actively managing this portfolio of investments with a focus on advancing our highest-value projects. As our opportunity set grows and conditions evolve, we continue to reassess our investment portfolio and prioritize our spend.
Each project must remain advantaged versus industry and competitive with our other opportunities. We work to ensure our assets remain a good strategic fit, provide material growth potential and ultimately create differentiating value. This is a continuous process and an essential element of our annual planning process. It is particularly important this year as we work to develop plans within the constraints brought on by the pandemic.
With the challenging price environment and our current debt levels, added emphasis is being placed on evaluating our entire portfolio for the potential of additional asset divestments. While continuing to progress our previously announced divestment program of $15 billion, we may expand it through a reevaluation of our North American dry gas assets, which are currently included in the corporation's long-term development plan. More specifically, we are evaluating the opportunity to bring the value of some of these assets forward by removing them from the development plan and marketing them through our divestment program. In total, the assets under consideration have carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion, which could be at risk for impairment depending on the candidates for divestment and the current estimate of their market value.
We expect to complete the review as part of our plan process, which will be finalized with the Board in November and will be shared with all of you as part of future earnings calls and at our analyst meeting early next year. Given the importance of the current market conditions on our plans and decisions, I'd like to return to the price and margin environment and the earnings potential of the corporation. Historically, our three businesses, each significant in the industry, are typically at different points in their business cycles which helps mitigate the impacts of their down cycles. In this unprecedented environment, all three businesses are simultaneously experiencing prices and margins below the 10-year range, significantly impacting the corporation's earnings.
We see the impact in the broader industry, with mounting losses, reduced investments and increased closures. And while questions remain around future demand recovery, one thing is certain: Current conditions cannot continue. Supply and demand will eventually meet. Prices and margins will respond.
This suggests there is much more margin and price upside than downside going forward, and therefore, an expected increase in earnings. For perspective, the earnings range over the prior 10-year period has been between $2 billion and $8 billion per year in the Downstream and between $1 billion and $5 billion per year in Chemical, a far cry from where we are today. And while we may not see a return to average earnings in the near term, we should at least move to the bottom end of the historic range, which we see as the minimum levels demonstrated by a decade of industry experience. This is the basis upon which we are building next year's plan.
If we see a recovery just to the bottom of the 10-year range and a Brent crude price in the range of credible third-party estimates, we will be able to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt flat with second-quarter levels. This morning, we've given you an overview of how we are navigating the challenging near-term market environment and discussed how market forces will restore supply and demand balances and improve the price and margin environment. The longer-term fundamentals remain robust. Economies will recover.
People's lives will improve, and the demand for energy will grow. In the short term, you've seen adjustments in our capital allocation. But our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable and growing dividend. We're developing a 2021 plan consistent with the uncertainties and in line with the simultaneous low margins and prices in each of our businesses.
Our capex will be further reduced to the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. We're further reducing our cash operating expense with a focus on overhead. We are looking to increase divestments and working to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt at second-quarter levels. Of course, we all recognize the uncertainty in today's market.
We are keeping a close eye on developments and, importantly, are maintaining the flexibility to respond as conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Before we open up the lines for your questions, I want to reemphasize that we're pleased with the operational performance we've achieved. We're on track to better the spending targets we established earlier this year, and we're positioning our portfolio for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back to Stephen to begin our Q&A session.
Stephen Littleton -- Vice president of Investor Relations and Secretary
Thank you for your comments, Jack and Andy. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions.
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Swiger and Mr. Williams.
[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Margolin -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
So on the capital program, you guys, basically already gave us a hint as to sort of the categories that you're committed to at close to pre-COVID levels and the ones that you see the most opportunity to stay back. So I guess I'll just focus my first question on the Permian. How much capital reduction in 2021 was already built-in because you've completed a lot of your facilities and infrastructure spends by that point? And then, how much do you think is the reduction in activity from what was planned before the crisis? Thank you.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks for the question, Sam. I mentioned earlier, we're at 15 rigs now, going down to about 10, and we think 10 to 12 rigs will be where we're going to be in '21. Of course, with an eye toward what the market does.
That's substantially down from our earlier plans, where we were planning to continue to, more or less, stay at a rig level in the kind of 50 rig, 50 to 60 rig level in the Permian. Growth is substantially down. But look, I just want to just reinforce that the decision to reduce the spin due to the cash flow constraints is not at all a reflection of our development results, it's quite to the contrary. We're very pleased with how things are going.
I mentioned the efficiency improvement that we've seen. We're continuing to gain experience with the cube developments and confirming those are a lot of value in that approach.So, we're very confident in the quality of the resource, including the unique development plan we have in the Delaware Basin, and then also the logistics integration we had at the Gulf Coast. So, we really like what we're seeing out there. We're just going to curtail activity because we have the discretion to do so and defer and move some of that capital to other opportunities.
Sam Margolin -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
And I think I have a follow-up, and I think it's for Andy, and it's about asset sales. A lot of your businesses are organized in JVs and equity affiliates and from the perspective of a Stock Analyst that usually doesn't mean anything. But right now, the dividend at Exxon's level is stressed, just given the environment. And that's a problem because it doesn't always align with the capital priorities of affiliates.
So, instead of thinking about disposals by asset category or segment, does it make sense to think about them from the perspective of asset class and maybe affiliate positions? And JVs are a logical place to look for disposals, because at the very least, you sort of align production with your cash, your uses of cash priorities?
Jack Williams -- Senior Vice President
Sam, thanks for the question. Our review for divestment candidates is quite comprehensive and it looks across every sort of different way you can cut the business. In terms of what we think is no longer a strategic fit, it's all the criteria for divestment, regardless of whether it's in a JV, an equity company, or a more conventional type of arrangements there.So, as we go through this and it's a process of continual renewal and review, we don't really find this sort of categories that you have suggested as being, as representing any sort of a barrier to analysis. There may be some friction depending on agreements in some of these arrangements and so forth, but by and large with how it's existed, we've worked with the operator or the other partners to reach a resolution and be able to put the right assets into the market at the right time.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
Good morning, Devin.
Operator
Devin, your line might be muted. OK. We'll move on to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan.
Phil Gresh -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Andy, I want to come back to Slide 29 where you were talking about the dividend coverage potential in 2021. If I look at the oil price, you're implying for the third quarter, being at the low end of historic range around $40 oil, and then you assumed recovery in refining margins there. I think the 2021 would imply the $2 billion of the $2.8 billion recovery there to get back to the low end, if I understood that correctly. So, I guess, are you trying to imply that you think you can, if you get a little bit of recovery in refining, that you can cover your dividend in the low 40s organically?
Andy Swiger -- Senior Vice President and Principal Financial Officer
