Brent crude oil futures fell almost 13% on March 16, sending the most important global oil price benchmark below $30 for the first time since Feb. 11, 2016, when it closed at $28.82 per barrel. The major U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, joined Brent in the rout, falling almost 10% to $28.63 per barrel. 
That puts both Brent and West Texas crude down more than 55% since early January, one of the fastest 50% drops for crude oil in decades.

What a difference a couple of months make. Going back to early 2020, expectations were the global oil demand would grow modestly in 2020 under relatively strong economic prospects. By early February, the outbreak and spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 quickly changed those expectations, with the International Energy Agency one of the first to warn that global oil demand would likely fall in the first quarter because of China's early efforts to arrest the spread of COVID-19. 
In early March, there was optimism that OPEC would reach an agreement to cut production in order to stabilize oil markets. Days later, OPEC proposed Russia join it for even bigger production cuts, with a deal to remove 1.5 million daily barrels of crude from the markets. 
Then Russia balked, and Saudi Arabia went scorched-earth, slashing oil prices and promising to flood the market with 13 million barrels of oil per day, being joined by fellow-OPEC-member United Arab Emirates, which committed to increase its oil production by about one-third starting in April. Since then, nobody has blinked, and Russia reportedly could produce even more oil when its current deal with OPEC expires at the end of March. Part of Russia's argument to not cut is that it, along with Saudi Arabia, have cut output multiple times in recent years, while U.S. producers have opened up the taps:

As a result of these global oil giants' actions, energy stocks have taken a pounding. Broader stock market indices have fallen around 30% at this writing in 2020, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLE) has fallen 54%. Global integrated giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A)(NYSE:RDS.B) have fallen 51% and 60.4% respectively. Oil producers ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which rely more on oil prices than their integrated peers, have fallen 60% and 74% respectively from their 2020 highs. 
The ongoing war between Russia and its erstwhile partners at OPEC is flooding oil markets and driving prices lower, but increased economic uncertainty is playing a significant role in the falling price of oil as well. 
The spread of COVID-19 around the world is accelerating, and governments are locking down on as many ways as people can spread the virus as possible. More than half of America's schools are now closed, and thousands of businesses have sent millions of employees home (some to telecommute while others are being furloughed). Every major professional sporting season has been either suspended or postponed, as have major college sports. The city of San Francisco just announced what essentially amounts to a citywide quarantine.

Many states are banning large public gatherings, and event promoters are cancelling events left and right. International air travel has been slashed and the cruise industry is all-but coming to a standstill. 
Over the weekend, the U.S. Federal Reserve caught markets by surprise when it announced major steps to keep financial markets functioning. A key inter-bank lending rate was slashed to essentially zero, while the Fed said it would inject $700 billion into financial markets to make sure banks had the necessary capital to continue lending during a period of massive economic uncertainty. 
Without a doubt, this is easily the most uncertainty the world's markets have dealt with since the Global Financial Crisis more than a decade ago. Even the U.S. federal government announcing it would buy 77 million barrels of crude oil for the U.S. Strategic Oil Reserve late last week wasn't enough step the big-picture fears that things will get worse before they get better. 
Two separate thoughts here. First off, this is absolutely, exactly the time investors should be looking to buy stocks. Market crashes have, time and again, proven the best time to buy stocks. 
But ... things are likely to get worse before they get better for many oil stocks, and that means investors should be very careful and selective in what they buy. A smart place to start is with oil stocks that have a strong margin of safety and balance sheets such as Shell and ExxonMobil, versus independent producers. Those companies need higher oil prices, and crude could stay depressed for longer than many producers can stay solvent. 
As much as it may look like there are dozens of bargain stocks in the oil patch right now, there's also significantly more risk of permanent losses than there was just two months ago. Now may be a better time to focus on other, lower-risk sectors with your buying, while building out a short-list of oil stocks to buy once market conditions start to normalize.

S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has cut the credit rating of oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) from AA+ to AA. The credit rating agency also maintained its negative outlook on Exxon's credit, with it warning of another downgrade if the company doesn't address its financial issues in the next 12-24 months. Exxon lost its long-held AAA rating in 2016 due to lower oil prices. 
S&P downgraded Exxon's credit because of its higher leverage metrics, weaker 2020 outlook, and large deficit between cash flow and outflows to fund its dividend and capital spending program. This move comes not that long after Exxon reaffirmed its long-term spending plans even though oil prices have weakened considerably due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Because of that, the company is on track to significantly outspend its cash flow in the coming years. According an estimate by RBC Capital, Exxon needs oil to average $77 a barrel this year -- and $68 a barrel in 2021 -- to generate enough cash flow to cover its dividend and capital spending program. That's well above the current price point in the low $30s. As such, Exxon will need to either borrow a significant amount of money to bridge the gap or make some substantial spending cuts.

Investors are growing increasingly concerned that Exxon might need to make drastic changes so that its financial situation doesn't deteriorate any further, including reducing its dividend. Given the decline in its share price, Exxon now yields more than 10%, which is a sign that the market has concerns about the long-term sustainability of its payout.

Brent crude oil futures crashed more than 10% in early Monday trading. At $30.56 per barrel (as of 10:25 A.M. EDT), the crucial international benchmark is now at its lowest level in more than four years. Brent prices last fell below $32 in February 2016.  
Futures prices on American benchmark WTI crude oil fell 10.3% to $29.52. WTI prices haven't been this low in more than 18 years.

This is curious news on the first trading day after President Trump announced plans Friday afternoon, to make massive purchases of crude oil for the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, saying "we're going to fill it right up to the top."
Commentators cite two main reasons for the downward move. First, the continuing oil price war between Russia and OPEC, with Saudi Arabia responding to Russia's refusal to cut oil production by dramatically cutting the price of Saudi crude. And second, the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates to as low as 0%.
The latter decision, announced Sunday, is aimed at injecting as much as $1.5 trillion in liquidity into U.S. markets to offset a downturn in spending as businesses close up shop and consumers cocoon to wait out the Coronavirus pandemic. Rather than reassure markets, however, it appears to have spooked oil investors with the implication that the economic situation is now so dire that only a revival of "quantitative easing" has any chance of ameliorating the damage.  
Stock prices of energy companies are taking it on the chin as a result of the plunging price of their primary product. In the first hour of trading, already shares of oil majors ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are down significantly, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is off 11%, and BP (NYSE:BP) down 13%.

Oil and gas companies blamed lower commodity prices for their poor fourth-quarter performance. WTI crude oil price averaged around $57 per barrel in 2019.
With oil prices in the low $30s, the oil majors are surely going to face heat. For instance, ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) projections for the next five years assuming $60 per barrel Brent price fall flat at current oil prices. So, what does this mean for investors?
Lower oil prices will negatively affect ExxonMobil's upstream earnings, though its downstream earnings may benefit slightly from lower prices. However, the negative impact on upstream earnings may far outweigh downstream gains. In the longer term, sustained low prices will very likely force ExxonMobil to cut on its investment plans.

However, Exxon has since realized the importance of low-cost supply. So, it has been divesting assets with higher per barrel production costs. At the same time, it is investing in assets with much lower costs of supply. The company's key growth projects, including in the Permian Basin and Guyana, are expected to generate double-digit returns at $40 per barrel Brent price. That's not so far away from where prices stand currently.
Additionally, the company plans to raise production in the Permian Basin at a rate such that it achieves around 10% returns at $35 per barrel Brent prices. That cost of supply may set ExxonMobil for sustained growth in the longer term.
Similarly, ExxonMobil's break-even rates at Guyana are far below $40 Brent. Exxon plans to develop the resource in phases, which will add incrementally to the company's production. Guyana production is expected to reach more than 750,000 barrels per day by 2025. 
The low-cost production should help Exxon stay profitable when oil prices are low. Of course, Exxon's transition into a low-cost producer won't happen in a day, but the company is working on it.

While Exxon's latest investments can produce oil much cheaper, the same can't be said for its existing assets. The company may have to increase its asset sales significantly from here on. For one, it can't keep producing oil at rates no one is buying. Secondly, it will need liquidity to fund its growth projects and other requirements.
ExxonMobil's free cash flow for 2019 didn't cover its dividends, though it generated impressive cash from operating activities. The company generated $29.7 billion in cash from operating activities in 2019. It spent $26.8 billion in property, plant, and equipment additions and net investments and advances and generated $3.7 billion in proceeds from asset sales. So, ExxonMobil generated free cash flows of $6.6 billion in 2019. It paid $14.6 billion in dividends for the year.  
As operating cash flows dwindle due to lower prices, Exxon will have to sell more assets, reduce spending, or ultimately cut dividends in order to maintain leverage.
Energy companies took years to adjust to around $50 per barrel of oil prices. It may take a few more years, at a minimum, for companies to reposition themselves in the changed scenario.
It will likely be a long wait -- which may chase away another chunk of investors from energy stocks, including Exxon. A likely positive for ExxonMobil is that oil in the low $30s might not last for years, helping the company in its transition.

2020 will be a historic year, with the COVID-19 outbreak sparking an extremely fast and sharp stock market drop into bear market territory. Even after the losses that investors have seen, there's still plenty of uncertainty about what the future will hold. Even the blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) have suffered significant losses, with every single one of the 30 stocks in the average down for the year as of March 13.
Defensively minded investors have often turned to a simple strategy that's easy to follow and has often offered some protection from downturns in the past. But the coronavirus has been highly disruptive to many investing strategies. The Dogs of the Dow have a solid track record, but they don't win every single year, and at least so far, the strategy's ability to outpace the broader average in 2020 is in great doubt. Let's take a closer look to find out why.
Investment
Price Change in 2020 Year to Date
Dow Jones Industrials
(18.8%)
Dogs of the Dow
(25.4%)
SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. AS OF MARCH 13.
In order to follow the Dogs of the Dow strategy, all you have to do is look up which 10 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials had the highest dividend yields at the beginning of the year. Once you know those 10 stocks, the strategy has you divide your portfolio into 10 equal parts and invest the same amount in all 10 of the Dogs of the Dow.
The basis for the Dogs of the Dow method is the belief that stocks fall out of favor one year are good prospects the next, and that companies paying substantial dividends offer some added protection compared to those with lower dividend yields. That's been true more often than not lately, with the annual return of the Dogs beating out the broader Dow in seven of the past 10 years.

A few major trends are largely responsible for the Dogs' underperformance so far this year:
In addition, the equal-weight method the Dogs of the Dow strategy uses has hurt its performance. Only three of this year's Dogs have share prices above $100, and that makes their influence on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average minimal. For instance, ExxonMobil's 45% drop gets a weighting of 10% in the Dogs, but only 1.1% in the broader benchmark.
We're less than three months into 2020, so obviously, there's a lot of time for the Dogs of the Dow to regain some of their losses. To do so, though, it'll take major reversals of several key trends like the declines in energy and materials stocks. A solution to the COVID-19 pandemic could bring such a reversal. Alternatively, it's possible that if the rest of the Dow Jones Industrials see further losses, it could eliminate the advantage that the broader average of blue chip stocks has had so far this year.
