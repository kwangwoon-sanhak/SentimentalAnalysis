Chesapeake Energy Corporation (OTC:CHKA.Q) is the second largest natural gas producer in the country. Only ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) pumps out more natural gas. Not only that, but it's the fourth largest pure-play onshore oil producer in North America. Needless to say, it's a top energy company.
Further, Chesapeake Energy is in the middle of a major turnaround to grow its higher-margin oil production in order to fuel higher profits and cash flow. This is yielding double-digit production growth while at the same time drastically reducing the company's leverage.
The combination of Chesapeake Energy's production strength with its current turnaround efforts make it a compelling stock for investors. Those without a position might be wondering if this is a good time to buy the stock. Let's take a take a closer look.
As part of its turnaround plan Chesapeake Energy is focused on growth that creates value. This strategy is laid out on the following slide, where the company points out that it plans to lead the industry in capital efficiency while reducing its leverage and complexity to grow its core areas and its cash flow.

This is a strategy borne out in the company's numbers. In this next slide, we look at a company that has dramatically cut its capital expenses as it focuses on being more efficient with its capital.

What's pretty remarkable is that even with the major cuts in capital spending, Chesapeake Energy is still able to grow. In this following slide, the company points out that its cash flow matches its capex, and yet the company is still growing production by 9%-12% while also slashing its leverage by 20%.

Add it all up and we have a compelling turnaround. The only question that remains is if we can invest in this turnaround at a decent price. For that, we need to drill down a bit deeper into the company's valuation.
In an effort to put a realistic value on Chesapeake Energy I'm going to look at a basket of four common energy valuation multiples for the company and four of its closest peers. The peers I'm using -- Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) -- are among the top tier of independent oil and gas companies in North America.
Here's how Chesapeake Energy compares:

What we see here is that on a relative basis Chesapeake Energy is a lot cheaper than its price to earnings multiple would lead us to believe. This is why I personally never use that valuation multiple when looking at an oil and gas stock because it can be affected by items such as hedging gains or losses as well as asset write-downs that obscure the whole story. By drilling down a little deeper into a couple of other valuation multiples, we see that Chesapeake Energy is cheaper than Devon Energy when it comes to its enterprise value to EBITDA, while it's the cheapest of the bunch when comparing the price to tangible book value. This tells us that, relative to its peers, Chesapeake Energy might be a good stock to buy.
Now I'm going to compare Chesapeake Energy's current valuation to its historical valuation by going back a decade and seeing how the company's current valuation multiples stack up to its historical average.

Here we see that aside from its price to earnings ratio Chesapeake Energy is trading below many of its historical average valuation multiples over the past 10 years. In fact, the company's enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is particularly compelling, as the current ratio is at a nice discount to the company's historical average as well as to the current multiple of most of its closest peers.
From this, we can conclude that today is actually a pretty good time to buy Chesapeake Energy's stock. The company is making solid progress on its turnaround plan, and its stock is selling at a compelling valuation both compared to its closest peers as well as to its historical valuation.

SOURCE: KINDER MORGAN 
Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) is the third largest energy company in North America. It owns an interest in or operates 80,000 miles of pipelines. That's enough to circle the earth more than three times. Needless to say it's a massive company. And yet, few people outside of the energy or investing world have even heard of Kinder Morgan. However, despite the fact it's a relatively unknown company Kinder Morgan really is the type of blue chip stock that could anchor an investor's portfolio. 
Blue chip stocks are large, well-established and financially sound companies that have been around for a long time. A blue chip stock is typically a market leader and has a reputation for quality, reliability, and profitability in good times and in bad. Blue chip stocks also typically are well-known and pay a dividend. The bluest of the blue chip stocks make up the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
When we read that overall description of a blue chip stock we could easily be describing Kinder Morgan. It's already the third largest energy company in North America by enterprise value, behind just ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It's also the largest midstream company in North America and as the following slide shows it's the market leader in several key energy infrastructure segments.

Not only is it a market leader, but most of its revenue and profits are very secure as it operates a toll road-like, fee-based business. This enables it to profit even if the prices of the commodities it transports fall. The stability of Kinder Morgan's profitability enables it to pay a very secure and growing dividend. In fact, the company's dividend is projected to grow faster than most other blue chip stocks, as the following slide points out.

If there is anywhere that Kinder Morgan falls short of other blue chip stocks it's the fact that it's not quite a household name yet. Consumers can't pull up to a Kinder Morgan branded gas station and complain about the price of gas, even though Kinder Morgan is likely getting its cut somewhere along the value chain as it transports more gasoline and other petroleum products than any other company in the country. Still, the fact that its brand isn't as well known by consumers doesn't really matter since Kinder Morgan's customers are energy companies that need to transport natural gas and oil-based products and these companies keep coming back and asking Kinder Morgan to expand its empire even further.
This is why the company is sitting on a $17 billion pipeline of identifiable future organic growth opportunities. That's a massive opportunity set for a $140 billion company to keep growing in the years ahead. Moreover, given the oil and gas boom in North America, there are plenty of opportunities beyond the company's current backlog to support future growth.
Add it all up and Kinder Morgan is well qualified to be considered a blue chip stock. In fact, because it's better insulated against falling oil and gas prices it offers investors an even safer option than fellow energy blue chip stocks ExxonMobil and Chevron. So, investors looking for a blue chip energy stock need to look no farther than Kinder Morgan.
