As investors prepare to bid farewell to a successful 2013 for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI), they've started to position themselves to identify the trends that could produce the most profits for 2014. You can see some of the crosscurrents in the Dow's performance today, with an overall gain of 26 points hiding some tension beneath the surface among two important sectors of the market. Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) were among those stocks that climbed the most today, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were both on the losing side.
The bull market might celebrate its fifth anniversary in a few months, but only now are consumers really starting to trust in the staying power of the rally and the accompanying economic recovery. For Disney, which gained 2.5% today, identifying the long-term value of entertainment by making major high-risk acquisitions of content-producing companies has turned out to be a prescient move, with the potential to drive future growth for years as consumers get more financially healthy and can afford to spend more. Even as cable companies and streaming-video providers fight over getting high-quality content, Disney has what they want the most -- and so far, the media giant has capitalized on those willing to pay for Disney's content.
The other thing that the recession forced consumer stocks to do is to make the most of tough situations. That's what helped drive Coca-Cola stock higher by 1.1%, with analysts over the weekend pointing at the soft-drink giant's capacity to mount a comeback despite concerns about the health impact of its sugary beverage lines. A stronger consumer has more capacity to contribute to growth in other more popular drinks like flavored water and juice, and as long as Coca-Cola can use its extensive distribution networks and smart operational savvy on the bottling front, it should be able to adapt to changing trends and eventually produce more growth.
Energy, though, presents a greater conundrum for investors, as Exxon dropped 1.2% and Chevron declined 0.8% today. On one hand, an economic recovery should boost energy use, creating demand that should support prices and help Exxon and Chevron boost their overall profits. Yet on the supply side, smaller producers are clamoring to restart projects that they suspended when natural gas prices were much lower, and the resulting increase in available oil and natural gas could present problems for the energy giants. Moreover, as the revolutionary recovery strategies pioneered in the U.S. spread abroad more extensively, they could boost supply even further -- solving the problem of sustaining production levels but only at the cost of price drops. Exxon and Chevron will have to search out ways to diversify their holdings in order to benefit from changing trends in energy in the long run.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Stocks were essentially unchanged today; with one trading day left in 2013, that means they will see the year out at or near a record high. The S&P 500 was down just two hundredths of a percentage point, while the narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) did achieve a new all-time high off a 0.16% gain.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett likes to cultivate the image of a down-to-earth businessman, but when it comes to deal-making, he can get pretty creative. In a deal announced after the market close on Monday, Berkshire is acquiring Phillips Specialty Products, or PSPI, from downstream energy company Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) for roughly $1.4 billion. But here's the kicker: Buffett will be paying for the acquisition with shares of Phillips 66 from Berkshire's stock portfolio! Why structure the deal that way?
PSPI develops polymers (large molecules) that maximize the flow in pipelines. Buffett's to-the-point comment on the business: "The flow improver business is a high-quality business with consistently strong financial performance, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway. I plan to have James L. Hambrick, CEO of The Lubrizol Corporation, oversee its strategic direction." Lubrizol is the specialty chemicals manufacturer that Berkshire acquired in September 2011 for around $9.7 billion, so Hambrick is a logical choice for that role.
The exact number of Phillips 66 shares Berkshire will fork over "will be determined by the share price at deal closing," which is expected to occur in the first half of 2014. However, in a filing with the SEC on Monday, Phillips 66 pegs the payment at "approximately 19 million shares." Nineteen million shares are worth $1.42 billion at Monday's closing price.
Why is Buffett paying for the deal with shares rather than in cash? First, it might give him an advantage: There is no mistaking the value of cash, but I think Buffett probably has a better idea of Phillips 66 shares' intrinsic value than the company's own executives. Berkshire has owned shares of Phillips 66 since the company was split off from ConocoPhillips in the second quarter of 2012.
Nevertheless, Buffett can only achieve that advantage if the Phillips 66 shares are actually overvalued, which doesn't appear to be the case -- not to any obvious degree, in any case. At 11.7 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate, they trade at a lower multiple than another Berkshire energy holding, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) (12.9 times).
Instead, I think it's likely the market valuation of Phillips 66 is expensive relative to the valuation Buffett obtained on PSPI. Without more financial data on PSPI there is no way to verify this, of course, but Phillips 66 was a motivated seller, as they want to focus "growth on our Midstream and Chemicals businesses." Finally, using the Phillips 66 shares enables Buffett to concentrate Berkshire's energy exposure on the name he likes best, ExxonMobil -- instead of one that reminds him of ConocoPhillips, an investment he described in his 2008 Annual Letter as a "major mistake of commission."
