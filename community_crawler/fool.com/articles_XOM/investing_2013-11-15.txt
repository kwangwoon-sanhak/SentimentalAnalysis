Stocks continued their gravity-defying rise today as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) brushed off some underwhelming economic reports today to finish up 85 points, or 0.5%, at 15,962. Yesterday's positive reaction to Fed chair nominee Janet Yellen's hearing seemed to carry the market higher for the second day in a row as investors applauded Yellen's vigorous defense of Federal Reserve's action to stimulate the economy under current Chair Ben Bernanke. The market has clearly been partial to the $85 billion monthly bond-buying program as it has arguably been the main factor in driving stocks up 25% this year. While Yellen conceded that the program has to end eventually, she seems to believe that it should continue until unemployment returns to normal levels.
The bullish sentiment helped the market ignore lower-than-expected figures from a New York state manufacturing report and a decline in export prices and industrial production in October.
ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) led the Dow, finishing up 2.2% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) disclosed a new $3.45 billion stake in the energy giant. As a cheap, blue-chip stock with steady cash flows and a dividend payout, Exxon is a typical Buffett favorite, but the oil majors have seen declining production as easy oil gets harder to find. Declining consumption in the U.S. could also present problems for the industry going forward.
In more fund news, J.C. Penney (OTC:JCPN.Q) shares finished up 4% as a number of hedge funds took positions in the ailing retailer in the last six weeks, including Highfields Capital, Farallon Capital Management Group, and Jana Partners. In total, the funds bought 8.1 million shares of J.C. Penney, or about $65 million, depending on the time of his investment. Other funds dumped shares of Penney, but the rush in seemed to add to investor confidence, especially after the department store chain reported slightly positive same-store sales for October. We'll learn more about Penney's prospects for a turnaround when it reports earnings next Wednesday. Analysts expect a per-share loss of $1.72. For the first time in more than a year, analyst projections seem low enough that Penney could actually beat them. A sequential improvement over Q2's $2.20 loss would, at the very least, show some improvement.

Yesterday, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) revealed a new stake in energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Berkshire's 13F filing stated that the company owned a $3.45 billion interest in Exxon as of the end of September. The purchase accounts for less than 1% of Exxon's shares outstanding.
Berkshire is helmed by Warren Buffett, the renowned value investor. Given the size of this purchase, it's likely Buffett himself directed this investment. Berkshire also reduced its position in oil producer ConocoPhillips during the quarter.
Motley Fool analyst Simon Erickson believes this move speaks volumes for both Berkshire and ExxonMobil. It's another example of Buffett's focus on the long term, and Simon expects Berkshire will likely add to this position over time. Given Exxon's steady returns and long-established dividend, Simon thinks it's a great candidate for any portfolio.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Federal Reserve chair nominee Janet Yellen put in a competent performance before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, giving a staunch defense of the Fed's quantitative-easing program. The confirmation looks to be all but sewn up, and traders will surely appreciate the prospect of a new central-bank chief who is perceived to be a dove. After hitting another record high on Thursday, stocks opened modestly higher this morning, with the S&P 500 and the narrower, price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) up 0.1% and 0.25%, respectively, at 10:10 a.m. EST.
Warren Buffett's confectionery-to-insurance conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) disclosed its stock positions at the end of the third quarter in a filing with the SEC late yesterday. The most significant piece of information in the disclosure is a significant new position in energy supermajor ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), to the tune of 40.1 million shares worth $3.4 billion at the end of last quarter.
However, true to form as a stock picker, Buffett is not simply making a broad bet on the energy sector; he likes ExxonMobil specifically. This is evident in yesterday's filing: Berkshire has reduced its stake in ExxonMobil competitor ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) by some 44%.
Berkshire became ConocoPhillips' largest shareholder during the third quarter of 2008, at the height of the credit crisis. However, Buffett made a public mea culpa regarding that decision the following year in Berkshire's 2008 shareholder letter, writing:
I told you in an earlier part of this report that last year I made a major mistake of commission (and maybe more; this one sticks out). Without urging from Charlie or anyone else, I bought a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices that occurred in the last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40-$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.
In his defense, ConocoPhillips' stock looked extremely cheap during the third quarter of 2008, trading at an average premium of just 20% over its book value (the equivalent premium for ExxonMobil during that period was 223%). And the shares have hardly been a disaster since then; in fact, they've essentially matched the S&P 500 in a strong bull market (though with greater volatility).

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has substantially lagged the index over the same period, but most of that underperformance has opened up this year. While the shares continue to trade at a substantial premium to those of ConocoPhillips, that gap has narrowed significantly; as of yesterday's close, Exxon's book value multiple is 2.41 against 1.77 for ConocoPhillips.
In truth, ExxonMobil always looked like the better fit within Berkshire's equity portfolio: The company is singularly focused on economic profitability and returning profits to shareholders. Now, following a period of stock underperformance, Buffett is signaling that the price is right -- watch for that underperformance to narrow and, ultimately, reverse over the next several years.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
The futures markets pointed toward a favorable start for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) as of 9 a.m. EST, with gains of 29 points potentially extending the Dow's record run from yesterday. As the bull market has continued to climb higher, investors have seen contributions from both megacap stock giants and rising upstarts; ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) represent good examples from both ends of the bullish spectrum.
On the small-cap side, 3-D printing has been a red-hot niche in the industrial sector, and last night's earnings report from voxeljet has renewed investor enthusiasm in the space, with the stock up more than 9% in pre-market trading. Revenue for the large-format industrial 3-D printer maker rose a whopping 77% as voxeljet boosted its gross margin by more than 7 percentage points. Despite a wider loss, sales of three new printers represented more than half of its total revenue. Custom-printing services also played an important role in the company's performance, rising 12% from year-ago levels. Voxeljet came public a month ago at just $13 per share, but the stock has already quadrupled since then.
At the other end of the spectrum, energy behemoth ExxonMobil traded up 1.5% in pre-market trading, with the company getting a lot of attention from Warren Buffett's big purchase of the stock. Far from a high-growth momentum play, Exxon has actually languished until recently, as concerns about its ability to sustain production levels kept many investors from looking at the integrated oil giant. But in its third-quarter earnings report, ExxonMobil reported production growth, with gains on the oil and liquids side helping to pace strong results in its upstream segment.
In international markets, bullishness continued to abound, as Japan's Nikkei climbed another 2% while most European markets were up a more modest quarter-percent to half-percent as of 9 a.m. EST. With a reading on European inflation weighing in at its lowest level in four years at just 0.9% annually, fears of deflation have redoubled resolve among policymakers to keep interest rates low in the Eurozone for as long as it takes to avoid what could become a crippling downward spiral of prices.

Warren Buffett has a penchant for buying great companies that are out of favor, and this quarter ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) fit that bill. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) just disclosed to the SEC that it held $3.4 billion worth of shares in ExxonMobil over the past quarter. So why did Buffett decide on ExxonMobil and not other out-of-favor Big Oil companies like BP (NYSE:BP) or Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A)? To better understand this purchase, let's analyze ExxonMobil based on two quotes from Buffett.
"Our favorite holding period is forever"
To better understand this investment thesis, we need to view this investment thesis over Warren Buffett's investing time horizon. So this move probably wasn't made on some quick fix, but rather the very long-term outlook for ExxonMobil. The past few years, ExxonMobil has gobbled up capital in a way that brings images of Cookie Monster to mind because it has been funding a very large amount of mega development projects. These projects have been difficult to execute and costs have ballooned to levels that you and I can barely comprehend. But the reason that Exxon and its peers have been willing to spend so much on these projects is that they will remain productive for a very long time. 
There is one project that is the embodiment of this: the Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan. This project has been the poster child of the challenges that the oil industry faces today. Just the first phase of the project has cost $50 billion and Exxon and Shell estimate that they will need to be involved beyond 2040 to make a decent rate of return. Luckily for them, the 13 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the region will be more than enough to keep production going that long. The Kashagan project, the Kearl oil sands mining project in Canada, and Exxon's joint venture with Rosneft to develop oil and gas fields in the Arctic are all examples of Exxon looking at securing oil and gas production that will last the company for decades to come. 
For an investor like Buffett, these are kind of things that will make ExxonMobil an attractive investment.
"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"
Many investors have been discouraged with the performance of Big Oil over the past few years because they have been pouring so much money into these capital projects. The five largest integrated oil and gas companies have all underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years on a total return basis.

What is probably more surprising, though, is that Exxon has only beat out BP over that time in terms of share performance, and BP has been dragged down by the Macondo spill for the past three years. One of the big reasons is because so much of that capital has gone into projects that have not yet produced a barrel of oil instead of investments with a shorter turnaround.
But this is the name of the game when it comes to investing in Big Oil. They can spend massive amounts of capital over several years to get these projects off the ground, then wind it down once these projects have come online. On Exxon's most recent conference call, management has said that it will start to wind down capital expenditures as some of these projects come online. So it is very possible that management will start to employ a more aggressive share buyback program or other shareholder-friendly actions over that time period. So it would seem that Buffett is loading up on Exxon at a pretty good time. 
What a Fool believes
Exxon is far from a slam-dunk investment. The company has been relying much more on third parties for production and their asset profile has been tending more and more toward less profitable natural gas. It's uncertain what kind of long-term impact it will have on the company, but Exxon has been around for decades and has dealt with other major problems in the past. It is still a stalwart in the oil and gas business, and it has been out of favor with many investors for the past year or so. Combine those two things, and you get the Warren Buffet stamp of approval.
