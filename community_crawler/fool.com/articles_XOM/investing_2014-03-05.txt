After news out of Ukraine dominated the markets for the first two days of the week, trading was calmer today as investors responded to a tepid jobs report from ADP and remarks from the Fed on the current state of the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) finished down 36 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 closed essentially unchanged, down 0.1 points from yesterday's record. 
The nation's biggest payroll processor said 139,000 jobs were added in February, short of analyst estimates at 150,000, but up slightly from last month's total of 127,000. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, cited "bad winter weather" for the poor growth numbers, and said, "Jobs growth is expected to improve with warmer temperatures." In its beige book report, a survey of the nation's 12 economic districts, the Federal Reserve confirmed Zandi's conclusion, saying that economic activity slowed in New York and Philadelphia due to severe weather, but eight of the districts saw "modest to moderate" growth. Finally, the ISM Services report showed declining activity in that sector as its index fell from 54.0 to 51.6, worse than estimates of 53.5.
Among stocks making news today was Target (NYSE:TGT), as its chief information officer, Beth Jacob, resigned in the wake of the retailer's data-breach scandal, which saw hackers access more than 40 million credit card numbers. Target said Jacob made the choice on her own, but it's easy to speculate that she was forced out. Jacob's departure may be an important step for the company to move past the security failure, and Target also said it would accelerate its roll-out of a $100-million chip-based credit card technology initiative, which is considered more secure that the traditional magnetic strip.  The effects of the data breach have been significant as sales fell off 5.3% last quarter and profits dipped 46%. The stock had fallen as much as 12% in the intervening time period, but has mostly recovered as its earnings report was not as bad as feared. Shares fell 1.2% today.
Back on the Dow, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) was the blue chips' worst performer of the day, falling 2.8% after releasing disappointing guidance for the year. The energy giant said it expects flat output for the year, but sees expenses falling 6%, news that disappointed investors who had hoped to see growth in production return. So-called easy oil has been harder to find for majors like Exxon and Chevron, and production has generally been on the decline for the past few years. While share buybacks and cost-cutting measures should assure investors that earnings per share will grow, flat or declining production is no long-term strategy for success. Still, analysts expect output to increase from 2015 to 2017 at a growth rate of 2%-3% as the company says it has more profitable projects coming on line.

A disappointing ADP jobs report left the major indexes struggling today. At the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 35 points, or 0.22%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.01%. The Nasdaq managed to finish in the black, but just barely, up 0.14%.  
February's job figure of 139,000 came in below economists' expectations of 155,000, while January's original 175,000 number was revised down to 127,000. The markets didn't take kindly to the news, though the Dow itself was a mixed bag. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), gaining 1.88%, led the 12 components moving higher, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), down 2.82%, was the worst of the 18 stocks that declined.
Goldman's move came on higher-than-normal volume of 4.45 million, compared with a three-month daily average of 3.1 million. The bump could have come in part from a recent Bloomberg rating indicating that the bank is a top merger-and-acquisition advisor. As companies find their growth slowing and look for new revenue streams, the market may be ripe for mergers, which would put Goldman in a good position. M&A advising also pays well, as Bloomberg estimated that Goldman made $1.23 billion in fees from such deals in 2013.  
Exxon's drop, meanwhile, comes after management told investors it expects flat production this year of around 4 million barrels of oil per day. In the long term, though, Exxon plans to cut low-margin wells, which will help profits in the long run and will reward investors with a long-term view. For more about this issue, click here.  
Outside the Dow, and helping the Nasdaq finish higher for the session, shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose 4.03% after a Stifel analyst increased his price target from $72 to $82. The analyst said Facebook "continues to gain share of the overall marketing spend," which would bode well for the company and would ease concerns about whether Facebook's ads are working with customers.

The S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) pulled back ever-so-gently from its record close yesterday, as a gauge of U.S. private sector employment came in below expectations. The ADP employment report, often considered an indicator for the Labor Deartment's monthly nonfarm payrolls report, showed soft jobs growth in February. That said, the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book," which is released eight times a year and details current economic conditions, blamed low economic growth in early 2014 on the weather. Let's hope it's the weather. Unsure whether to blame Mother Nature or accept the idea of a poor labor market, the S&P 500 finished sideways, losing 0.1 points, or 0.01%, to end at 1,873. 
ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shareholders had no trouble figuring out which way the stock should go today, sending shares down 2.8% in trade. Exxon committed to cutting costs this year, forecasting cost reductions that will run all the way through 2017. Cost reductions weren't behind today's slump, though -- lousy production rates were. Exxon's projected 2014 oil and natural gas production is expected to remain flat from last year; not only that but the company expects to drill in the Russian Arctic later in 2014, plans that could be put off if the U.S. imposes sanctions against Russia for its hostility toward Ukraine. 
Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), a Texas company that produces oil and natural gas, saw shares lose 2.8% on Wednesday. The loss is mostly attributable to the fact that Wednesday was an awful day to be in the oil and gas business -- the sector was the worst performing of the 10 market sectors. That's because the price of oil fell 1.8% as tension from the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to subside; natural gas prices also fell 3% today. Natural gas's relative affordability due to the U.S. energy boom in recent years is one reason Exxon made the conscious decision to decrease its natural gas production in 2014, as it waits for the supply glut to disappear. 
Lastly, shares of $21 billion generic pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) slipped 2.4% today. Pops and drops like today's are nothing out of the ordinary for Mylan investors, who -- when including last week's 9% jump after an exemplary earnings call -- have seen shares jump 80% in the last year alone. Mylan's gross margins in the fourth quarter were great at 51%, and revenue growth was driven by the company's partnership with Pfizer, in which Mylan markets the EpiPen, a product used to treat severe allergies. As for today's decline, it's nothing for investors to lose their heads over.

Stocks have slowed down after yesterday's rally and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) has given back some of those great gains it picked up on Tuesday. As of 2:30 p.m. EST, the Dow was down more than 38 points, with most member stocks falling after disappointing private-sector hiring data dampened investor optimism. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is the Dow's clear-cut loser today by shedding 2.9%. Let's catch up on what you need to know.
Jobs gains remain elusive
Automatic Data Processing released its February private-sector payroll report today, and the statistics don't add any silver lining to what has been a disappointing winter season for the U.S. economy. According to ADP's report, the private sector added 139,000 total nonfarm jobs in February, disappointing economists heading into the government's own jobs report slated for release on Friday. The 139,000-job gain is far less than the 205,000 private-sector positions added in February 2013, although it's a step up from January's poor result, lending credence to the suspicions that this year's exceptionally poor weather has held back the economy's gains.
Around the Dow, Exxon tumbled after the company projected it would spend 6.4% less on capital efforts this year despite expecting to start up production at 10 new projects in 2014, a record for the company. Exxon predicts capital spending to come in at $39.8 billion this year, with annual average spending of $37 billion between 2015 and 2017.
Investors haven't been too pleased with Exxon's progress as of late. The stock has gained only roughly 8% over the past year, trailing much of the Dow's gains over that time. The company's most recent earnings report in late January failed to build up any optimism; Exxon missed on analyst expectations for its bottom line as earnings per share slumped by 14% year over year. Those 10 projects due to begin his year serve as the beginning of Exxon's plan to kick off new projects in natural gas and oil production in order to drive growth. However, for cautious investors, the Big Oil company will have to perform before this stock sees better days.
Elsewhere on the Dow, Big Pharma's Merck (NYSE:MRK) has had a tough day despite revealing upbeat new data. The health care stock has shed around 0.3% despite the company's developmental dust mite allergy drug MK-8237 hitting all the right notes in a recent phase 2b clinical trial. This isn't Merck's strongest drug in its pipeline by far, but it's nonetheless a victory for investors who have struggled with the company's high research and development spending and failure to produce many strong market contenders. While all eyes turn toward Merck's developmental cancer therapy MK-3475, a potential blockbuster, every strong clinical study performance helps.

During the first two days of the week, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) were whipsawed by the fast-developing story in Ukraine, with initial aggressive moves by Russia over the weekend causing big stock market losses, followed Tuesday by a more conciliatory tone that sent stocks soaring. Today, though, the Dow is taking a break from the volatility, falling just 27 points as of 11 a.m. EST. Nevertheless, there are still some mixed currents within the blue-chip stocks, with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) falling more than 2.5% while financial stocks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) respectively rose about 2% and 1.5%.
ExxonMobil's drop came after it announced capital spending plans for 2014 this morning. Even though the company expects to spend almost $40 billion on capital projects this year, the amount still represents a 6% cut from its record level in 2013. Moreover, despite 10 major new products starting production this year, the company's overall levels of oil and gas production will remain little changed in 2014, again showing the challenges that Exxon and other oil giants have in maintaining production levels from declining legacy assets. Even hopes for better growth rates from 2015 to 2017 weren't enough to make investors more upbeat about Exxon's future.
The current market environment has been kinder to Goldman and JPMorgan. Even as the debt markets started to see turbulence from rising rates, JPMorgan led the annual rankings from Bloomberg Markets among debt underwriters. Moreover, with increasing amounts of merger and acquisition activity, both JPMorgan and Goldman are positioning themselves to take maximum advantage of greater deal volume, hoping to cash in on lucrative fees for advising clients, as well as the resulting underwriting of debt and equity that often proves necessary in M&A deals. With Goldman's success in underwriting the Twitter IPO, the importance of helping other companies in making initial public offerings could also play a key role for it and JPMorgan's investment banking businesses, especially as many investors have bemoaned the lack of good growth-stock opportunities among publicly traded companies.
Investors shouldn't expect this morning's pause to last for long, given how turbulent the Dow has been in 2014. But until the next piece of major news hits, investors should take the break as an opportunity to assess their portfolios and consider how they want to position themselves for the long-term future.
