U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is planning to cut 1,900 jobs, or about 2.6% of its workforce, according to an Oct. 29 press release. The news comes about three weeks after the company announced an estimated 1,600 job cuts in Europe.
In March, the Saudi Arabia-Russia oil price war caused global oil prices to crash. Then the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic destroyed demand for oil, resulting in ExxonMobil making a commitment to major spending cuts. These workforce reductions are the latest part of that cost-reduction plan.

Employees of the largest U.S. oil and gas specialist had been bracing for such an announcement after receiving an Oct. 21 email from CEO Darren Woods regarding the state of the company.
At first, Woods discussed ExxonMobil's cost-cutting efforts so far in 2020.  According to Woods, these have included "deferring more than $10 billion in capital and cutting 15% of cash operating expenses."
However, the CEO went on to say, "I wish I could say we were finished, but we are not. We still have some significant headwinds, more work to do and, unfortunately, further reductions are necessary." 
"Making the organization more efficient and more nimble will reduce the number of required positions and, unfortunately, reduce the number of people we need," he concluded. 
According to Thursday's press release, the reductions will come primarily from the company's Houston headquarters. "These actions will improve the company's long-term cost competitiveness and ensure the company manages through the current unprecedented market conditions," it said.
On Wednesday, ExxonMobil announced it would not raise its dividend this calendar year, for the first time in 18 years.

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) just did something it hasn't done in 18 years. The oil giant kept its dividend at $0.87 per share, the first time since 2002 it failed to increase the payout during a calendar year.
The decision doesn't put ExxonMobil's status as a Dividend Aristocrat in jeopardy yet. That's because its total 2020 dividend payments will still be higher than 2019's total, preserving a 38-year streak.
The decline in consumer demand for oil because of the coronavirus pandemic has rocked the energy markets as large swaths of the economy were shut down and travel and tourism plans were shelved.

Although most of the country has largely reopened, oil prices remain depressed. West Texas Intermediate goes for around $35 a barrel today, almost double the $19 it hit during the depths of the pandemic, but still below the $43 at the end of August and well below the $54 a barrel where it traded a year ago.
Analysts were concerned Exxon would actually cut its dividend to conserve cash because the oil giant faces a $46.5 billion debt load. A portion of that, however, was meant to ensure it had sufficient liquidity during the pandemic, since CEO Darren Woods believed it was "appropriate to provide liquidity, given market uncertainties." Even so, Exxon reported a loss of over $1 billion in the second quarter, or $0.26 per share. 
The company is expected to begin cutting costs and jobs as soon as tomorrow, and analysts think the decision to maintain the dividend at its current level suggests it will see margin improvements due to the initiatives. That should let it maintain the payout at a rate that currently yields over 11% annually.

ExxonMobil notes it has paid a dividend for more than 100 years.

Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that ExxonMobil would no longer be eligible to be a Dividend Aristocrat and suggested that 2020 was the first calendar year in which the company had not increased its dividend since 1982. The author and the Fool regret the error.
