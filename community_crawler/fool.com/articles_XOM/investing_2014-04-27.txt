Earnings season isn't close to over, but we've already seen a huge number of stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) report their first-quarter results. So far, we've seen more companies do better than expected than do worse, but given the extent to which analysts lowered the earnings bar in the run-up to the beginning of earnings season, investors aren't entirely confident about whether the overall performance of corporate America is strong enough to keep the bull market in stocks roaring for a sixth straight year. This week, Dow components Merck (NYSE:MRK), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) will add their results to the mix, and what they say about some of the most challenging sectors of the U.S. economy right now could help determine which direction the Dow moves in the weeks and months to come.

Investors expect Merck to report 7% lower earnings on a revenue decline of about 2%, a string of contracting financial results that's expected to persist throughout 2014. The culprit: the loss of patent protection on blockbuster drugs that has hurt results throughout the entire industry hit Merck particularly hard. The company has nevertheless created enthusiasm among investors with promising new treatment prospects in the hepatitis C and cancer spaces, giving shareholders hope that Merck's plunge off the patent cliff won't produce a fatal fall. Yet drug development takes time, and clinical successes won't have a positive impact on Merck revenue and net income for years to come.
SOURCE: CHEVRON.
As the two energy giants in the Dow, ExxonMobil and Chevron face the same challenges of finding new assets in an increasingly competitive world for the energy industry. Chevron will have the harder time, with sales seen falling 4% and earnings per share taking a 21% dive for the first quarter. Chevron has already warned that its raw production volume would fall both in the oil and natural gas segments, citing bad weather conditions in many of its key regions, and other issues like asset writedowns and adverse currency impacts could weigh on earnings even further.
SOURCE: EXXONMOBIL.
Investors expect Exxon to produce a slight increase of less than 1% in revenue, helping to cushion the drop in earnings per share to around 11%. News that the company achieved a 103% reserve replacement rate in 2013 helped appease some concerns about Exxon's ability to sustain production volumes, and Exxon is clearly investing in major projects to discover new sources of future production. Yet the wildcard for Exxon in particular is the situation in Russia, with the potential for escalation in Russia's conflict with Ukraine raising worries about possible sanctions that could limit Exxon's ability to keep doing business in the Eurasian nation.
This week, Dow investors should keep their eyes on all three of these companies, with a particular eye toward seeing how each company expects to boost their future growth. All three of these Dow stocks have the potential to do great things if they can overcome the challenges they face.

Growth is an important part of the success of the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI). Over the course of the five-year bull market, most of the Dow's components have shown that they can rebound from the depths of a deep recession. But lately, stocks in three sectors have had difficulty keeping sales from dropping, and that could eventually have a big downward impact on their shares. Those three industries are heavy equipment, energy, and pharmaceuticals, and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Merck (NYSE:MRK) have had the biggest challenges in keeping revenue from dropping, based on comparing trailing 12-month revenue figures from S&P Capital IQ to those from a year ago.
Caterpillar's nearly 12% drop in revenue makes plenty of sense when you consider the economic difficulties that the construction- and mining-equipment manufacturer has faced. Caterpillar relies on healthy markets not just in the U.S. but also in key emerging-market areas like China, and slowing growth rates in the developing world and stagnant or even downright contractionary activity in construction and infrastructure spending in Europe and elsewhere in the developed world have combined to send Caterpillar's sales tumbling. Add to that the huge drop in mined-commodities prices over the past year, and you have a recipe for disaster at Caterpillar. Recently, the heavy-equipment giant has suggested that things might finally be bottoming out, but especially for Caterpillar's mining-company customers, it might still be a while before they're willing to make major capital expenditures again.
Energy companies are dealing with the constant struggles of replacing lost production from aging wells and dealing with a changing price environment for crude oil and refined products. Oil prices have been on the rise lately, and so some of the pressure that has sent ExxonMobil's revenue down 8% could finally let up in the future. Still, as Exxon and the Dow's other major energy component compete to tap promising prospects around the world, it'll get even more difficult to find undiscovered oilfields to replace played-out assets. High dividends and extensive share buybacks help cushion the blow for shareholders, but in the extreme long run, Exxon will have to address the supply challenges that will almost certainly force the entire planet eventually to consider alternatives to fossil fuels.
For Merck and other pharmaceutical companies, the revenue declines are likely to be shorter-lived. Merck has seen revenue fall about 7% due largely to blockbuster drugs going off-patent, with new generic competition stopping drugmakers from charging premium prices to patients. But Merck and its peers are working hard to replace those lost blockbuster sales with newly developed drugs with similar potential, and while those prospects are hard to come by, drug companies have had success with some of their newer treatments.
Of these three sectors, energy's sales issues will be the hardest to overcome, as they're limited by physical supply that's out of companies' control. By contrast, Caterpillar's woes look purely cyclical, and pharmaceutical companies like Merck show signs of finding new drugs to replace lost revenue relatively soon.
