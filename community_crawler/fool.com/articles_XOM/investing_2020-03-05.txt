Only a few days after reports that Saudi Arabia was planning to propose a 1 million barrel per day reduction in crude oil output to its OPEC counterparts, the group, which controls more than one-third of the world's oil, has now agreed on a massive 1.5 million barrel production cut.
Unlike the reaction to the Saudi proposal, which sent crude oil prices up more than 4%, oil markets are not viewing today's news nearly so favorably. At this writing, both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude futures are down slightly at $50.24 and $46.12 per barrel at recent prices.

Oil stocks are taking the news even less favorably. At this writing, shares of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) are down 5%, while the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explorer & Production ETF (NYSEMKT:XOP) is down 4%. 
While OPEC member states have agreed to the proposal, OPEC+ member Russia has not yet to agreed to participate in the cuts. According to the deal, OPEC members will shoulder the first 1 million barrels per day in cuts -- essentially what Saudi Arabia was proposing -- but is asking for the countries that make up OPEC+ to take on the additional half-million barrels in cuts. 
Russia is by far the largest non-core-OPEC producer in the OPEC+ group, and the full cuts that OPEC is asking from this group requires Russia's involvement. However, the country's leadership has said that while they are open to cooperation, president Vladimir Putin has also said that, "...for the Russian budget, for our economy, the current oil prices [sic] level is acceptable." 
Whether OPEC+ can agree to the full 1.5 million cuts will remain to be seen, but it's clear by the oil market's reaction that the general feeling is it may not be likely.

Following a big gain on Wednesday for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI), the index declined sharply on Thursday. By 11:40 a.m. EST, the Dow was down 2.36%. The novel coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. is raising fears of a major economic disruption. There are now more than 160 confirmed cases in the U.S. and 11 deaths.
One area already hit hard is travel, with multiple airlines warning about weakening demand. That's not good news for Boeing (NYSE:BA). Shares of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) were also under pressure on Thursday after the company updated its growth plans.
Shares of airplane and defense company Boeing were down 5.1% Thursday morning, underperforming a weak market. While there was no company-specific news, the plight of the major airlines as the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads seems to be weighing on the stock.

Boeing is already struggling as it tries to get the 737 Max flying again after two fatal crashes grounded the plane. With the outbreak crimping travel, Boeing may soon have a demand problem as well as a supply problem.
United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) announced on Wednesday that it was cutting its U.S. and Canada flights by 10% in April, along with a 20% cut to international flights. Some larger planes will be taken out of service as the airline tries to bring capacity in line with reduced levels of demand. United has also instituted a hiring freeze through at least June 30, excluding critical roles.
On Thursday, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) updated its guidance for the first quarter to reflect a significant decline in demand, as well as an increase in trip cancellations. Southwest expects to take a revenue hit between $200 million and $300 million in the first quarter, and operating revenue per available seat mile growth is now expected between negative 2% and positive 1%. Previously, Southwest had expected this metric to grow by 3.5% to 5.5%.
While it's too early to tell whether this slump in travel demand will cause airlines to pull back on plane orders, investors are nonetheless punishing Boeing.
Energy giant ExxonMobil was also down big on Thursday, with the already beaten-down stock losing another 4.6%. This move lower came after the company gave an update on its long-term growth strategy.
Exxon expects to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion on capital expenditures annually through 2025, with around $33 billion of spending this year. "We are taking advantage of a favorable cost environment and investing in advantaged projects -- underpinned by the long-term fundamentals of growing demand," said CEO Darren Woods.
In terms of individual projects, the company expects its production in Guyana to exceed 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025. In the Permian Basin, the company sees over 1 million oil equivalent barrels of production per day by 2024, although Exxon said that it was evaluating the pace of near-term development due to market conditions.
While oil prices have plunged this year, Exxon expects energy demand to continue to grow in the long run due to population growth and an expanding global middle class.

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) reaffirmed its plan to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion per year through 2025 on capital projects, including up to $33 billion in 2020. That confirmation comes even though the energy markets have weakened considerably this year due to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. The price of oil has plunged 20% in 2020, while natural gas is down to levels not seen since the 1990s. 
Speaking at the company's annual investor day meeting, CEO Darren Wood stated that Exxon is "mindful of the current market environment." However, Woods said that Exxon plans to maintain its current strategy of "leaning into this market when others have pulled back."

Exxon intends to use "the strength of our balance sheet to invest through the cycle," according to Woods. As such, it will outspend its cash flow when necessary to maintain its investment pace while also continuing to increase its dividend as it has for the last 37 consecutive years. It also aims to sell $15 billion in assets to help finance its investment plan. 
While Exxon isn't making any changes to its planned investment level, it is adjusting its development plan. Most notably, it will operate at a reduced pace in the Permian Basin over the next two years compared to its previous outlook. However, it still expects to produce more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from the region by 2024. 
Exxon fully believes that energy demand will grow in the coming years. That's why it's taking advantage of the current environment to invest while costs are lower so that it can cash in on more favorable future market conditions.

Shares of integrated energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) fell roughly 12% in February, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Peer ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) stock dropped even more, declining by 17%. Drilling-focused ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), meanwhile, was off a bit more than that, with its price falling by a little over 18%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index fell around 8% in the month.

If you look to the start of the year, however, the picture changes a bit. Chevron's stock price was off by 22% in the two-month span, Exxon's was down by 26%, and ConocoPhillips fell about 25%. Over that same period, the S&P's decline is still just about 8% or so. The coronavirus is important here, but there's a bigger story for these energy companies than the broad market drop that took place in February.
Obviously, the COVID-19-led sell-off has dragged Chevron, Exxon, and ConocoPhillips down along with it. But this is more than just market fear -- note that the trio of stocks began falling as soon as the virus started to gain increased global attention at the start of the year. The logic here is pretty simple.
Oil and natural gas have been in an oversupplied situation for some time, as growth in U.S. production has taken off in recent years. So the prices for these key global commodities were already weak. China, meanwhile, is one of the largest sources of demand for oil and gas. As that country started to take steps to contain the spread of the coronavirus, it was clear that energy demand was going to be impacted. With an already-oversupplied energy market facing a demand shortfall from one of its largest demand centers, oil prices quickly responded by, as you might have guessed, declining. The share prices of oil producers went along for the ride. All of that began well before Wall Street started to get the COVID-19 jitters in February.
Chevron has been the least impacted of this trio. That's likely because it had pulled back on spending before any of the coronavirus issues. Management has been touting that it has the lowest capital investment plans relative to cash flow of any of its major oil peers. Thus, an oil price decline would hurt, but perhaps not as much as at a peer like Exxon, which has been ramping up its spending plans. Spending up to $35 billion a year to find more oil when oil prices are falling isn't exactly a great backdrop for stock price gains at Exxon. Add in the demand shock from COVID-19 and that spending looks even less desirable to investors.    
ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, has been hard hit because it is focused exclusively on oil and natural gas drilling. Since the driller spun off its downstream (pipeline and refining) operations years ago, oil's ups and downs have a bigger impact on its financial results because there's no other businesses to provide an offset. Essentially, ConocoPhillips has doubled down on oil, and right now that's not working out too well.
Investors in Chevron, Exxon, and ConocoPhillips should be prepared for more volatility... and more downside risk. Even if China begins to recover, which should help support demand for oil and natural gas, COVID-19 is starting to spread to the rest of the world. That will likely mean demand concerns remain front and center and, thus, oil prices could stay weak or even fall further. And if COVID-19 leads to a global recession, well, the pain could get pretty intense.
