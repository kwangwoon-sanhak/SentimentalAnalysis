The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) on Wednesday finally lost some of its heat, falling 88 points as of 12:30 p.m. EDT. After such a strong rally, many traders have grown increasingly worried about the prospects for a sustained downdraft in the Dow; as the slow summer months approach, reduced trading volumes increase the opportunity for a rise in what has been historically low levels of market volatility. Moreover, on the economic front, global growth might be in danger of slowing, raising further doubt about the rise in international stock markets. Nevertheless, despite the dour mood on Wall Street, Merck (NYSE:MRK) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) posted gains today.

Merck's 0.6% gain comes as the stock continues to enjoy a honeymoon period after the company's aggressive buyout of hepatitis C treatment producer Idenix Pharmaceuticals. Spending almost $4 billion for a company that is almost entirely reliant on the future potential of treatments in early stages of the clinical trial process is obviously a large risk, but it's also a calculated move given the potential size of the hepatitis C market. Potentially even more valuable for Merck is the nature of the nucleotide-based treatment regimens, as giving Merck more expertise in the field could lead to treatments for other important diseases as well. Long before Idenix proves itself, though, Merck will have to find ways to maximize the value of its existing pipeline while perhaps seeking other acquisitions with more immediate positive impact on the company's prospects.

ExxonMobil rose half a percent as Brent crude approached the $110 per barrel mark and West Texas Intermediate climbed toward $105. The long glut of domestic oil appears to be dissipating, with inventories at the Cushing facility in Oklahoma hitting their lowest levels since late 2008 and the nationwide drop marking a two-month low. As unrest in Iraq threatens oil supplies and infrastructure, oil prices could continue to see upward pressure. In the near term, that could support Exxon's profits, although the oil giant also has to worry about prices rising so high that they threaten to bring on exactly the global economic slowdown that the World Bank and some other economists fear.
Even on a down day for the Dow, you can usually find stocks that buck the trend. One day doesn't establish a countertrend stock, but both ExxonMobil and Merck have strengths that make them worth a closer look for investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) has been America's most-watched market index for decades, despite -- or perhaps because -- of its narrow focus on a mere 30 stocks. Where other indices might track 500, or 2,000, or even 5,000 different stocks, the Dow's steady focus on 30 business bellwethers has made it both easier to understand and easier to dismiss as a relic of simpler times. But as long as the Dow remains front and center in every day-to-day market analysis, it and its component companies will remain the most important barometers of American markets.

That's why it's important to understand not only the Dow, but its components as well. What do they do? What do they represent on the Dow, and why do they matter to the American economy? Where have they come from and where might they be heading in the future? Today we'll dig into the details of Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to find answers to these questions and more, so that we can understand not just what moves the Dow, but why.
Chevron at a glance
Chevron has one of the most distinguished lineages of all Dow components, next to fellow former Baby Standard ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Both Chevron and ExxonMobil were integral parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire until its dissolution by antitrust decree in 1911, and Chevron -- first as Standard Oil of California and then under its current name following its 1984 acquisition of Gulf Oil -- has remained one of the world's largest and most powerful companies.
Not only was Chevron part of the most famous monopoly in history, it also created the world's most prolific oil producer, since it formed Aramco (now Saudi Aramco, which produces an estimated 12.5 million barrels of oil every day) in 1933 to tap the vast reserves beneath Saudi sands. Chevron is also closely linked to two of the most powerful oil gushers in American history -- the gusher at Spindletop, which single-handedly turned Texas into America's leading oil-producing state, and the Lakeview gusher in California, which remains the largest accidental oil spill in history over a century after it was finally stopped up.
Chevron is the eighth-largest company in America by market cap, the fifth-largest Dow component by market cap, and the second-largest publicly traded oil and gas company in the world by market cap, behind only ExxonMobil. It trails only 13 other companies globally by annual revenue (three are state-owned Chinese companies), but it's the eighth most-profitable company in the world. Getting oil out of the ground might not be as exciting as making the hottest tech gadget or the world's favorite blockbuster films, but it's been consistently (and hugely) profitable for Chevron for over 130 years.

Chevron is suffering the same problems faced by most of its massive oil and gas peers -- there's only so much oil to pump out of the ground, and new sources have proven weaker in yield and costlier to extract than the gushers of the past. Despite these issues, Chevron has done an admirable job at tightening belts that need to be tightened, but it has also undoubtedly benefited from consistently high post-crash oil prices, which have (at least in the case of internationally priced Brent crude) generally stayed above $90 per barrel since early 2011. This has helped offset the dreaded production decline that became a reality this year, when Chevron reported a 2% year-over-year dip in daily output.
It shouldn't surprise longtime oil-patch watchers to see tepid analyst assessments for this oil supermajor -- Wall Street expects Chevron to grow at an average rate of just 5.5% per year for the next half-decade, which is well below the overall industry's expectation for annualized growth of 17% for the same period. However, even a slow-growing Chevron is a much better stock for the Dow than a rapidly rising small oil producer. After all, if America's second-largest oil and gas company isn't a meaningful representative of the energy industry, what is?
