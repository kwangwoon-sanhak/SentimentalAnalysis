Only on Wall Street could disappointing manufacturing news be a bullish catalyst for the stock market. With factory output in April slipping to eight-month lows, investors reasoned that the Federal Reserve would be more reluctant to slow its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program. Financial stocks enjoyed a second straight day of impressive performance, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) gained 60 points, or 0.4%.
American Express (NYSE:AXP
) ticked up for a second straight day, adding 1.8%. While yesterday's gains were partially because of favorable comments made by a hedge fund manager about financial stocks, today's gains may actually be due to some refinancing moves American Express made. It will issue $1.85 billion in low-interest five-year notes in order to pay back $1 billion worth of debt costing nearly 5%. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM
) added 1.7% as financial stocks were the second-best performers of the day. Although manufacturing numbers were down, the housing markets don't seem to be doing too poorly: Homebuilders' confidence in May surged, as the resurgence in the domestic real estate markets could mean good things ahead for mortgage lenders like JPMorgan. 
The oil and gas sector was the only major sector to decline today, and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) shares acted unsurprisingly, slipping 0.8% as a result. Today, the company announced a $1.5 billion investment in an Argentine energy company, but for the $240 billion Chevron, that's just a drop in the bucket.
By far the biggest decliner in the Dow, shares of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) lost 2.6%. Coming off a first quarter where PC sales slumped at a rate never seen before, HP is going to have to adapt quickly or risk years and years of subpar returns. With data from the U.K. today showing a 20% drop in PC shipments in the first quarter, HP investors are getting antsy about the future of the market.

Ever since the late 1950s, when commercial quantities of oil were first discovered in Nigeria's Niger Delta basin, West Africa has been an area of interest for oil and gas exploration and production companies.  
But a host of challenges, many of them related to threats of violence and corrupt political regimes, dissuaded many of the world's leading energy companies from prospecting areas of Africa more thoroughly.
As of 12:45 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is up 0.53%, putting it just five points shy of 15,300. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is up 0.65%, while the Nasdaq is running in third, up just 0.36%. Investors are once again bullish today thanks to some encouraging economic data.
This morning the Department of Labor released data indicating that producer prices fell 0.7% in April, which is their largest drop in three years. Two reasons for the large decline were lower gasoline prices and falling food costs. According to a Reuters survey, economists were expecting a decline of 0.6%. This report may be seen more negatively with regard to higher revenue and profits for large companies, but it's a good thing for consumers, as they will likely have more money in their pockets after buying the essentials.
Additionally, homebuilder confidence has increased in May. The National Association of Home Builders reported that sales expectations have risen to their highest level in five years. 
But even though the markets in general are moving higher today, a few losers can still be found.
Shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are lower by 0.5% this afternoon. The producer price report is likely causing some of the decline, in addition to a 1.3% drop in the price of light crude and a 2.1% drop in the price of unleaded gas. Big oil companies are essentially at the mercy of the price of oil, and when prices dramatically fall, revenue and profits tend to go along for the ride. But investors need to focus on the long-term picture, not short-term or daily moves, if they own shares of any commodity-based business. 
Both Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
) and Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) are trading lower after two reports indicating that manufacturing is slowing were released today. The first was the industrial-production rate, which fell 0.5% in April, whereas many analysts were only expecting a 0.2% dip. On the positive side, though, the production rate was revised higher to a 0.3% increase in March. Further bad news for Alcoa was that the industry capacity utilization fell to 77.8% in April after hitting 78.3% in March. This report indicates the extent to which companies are deploying their resources. None of the data released today paints a good picture for either Caterpillar or Alcoa, and investors are trading out of each stock today, causing shares to fall about 0.5% each.

On this day in economic and business history...
May 15, 1911 brought a seismic shift to the relationship between the United States and its largest corporations. That day, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed a lower court's ruling that the monolithic Standard Oil trust represented an illegal monopoly and would have to be broken apart. Its decision hinged on the "unreasonable" nature of Standard Oil's anticompetitive efforts, which ran afoul of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act. Whether through predatory pricing, industrial espionage, or sheer unassailable size, Standard Oil had simply become too big to beat -- until the government finally beat it back.
The decision was a long time coming. As far back as 1882, when John D. Rockefeller first formed the trust out of a myriad assortment of smaller oil enterprises, it was clear that his rapid efforts to out-scale all competition would result in market domination. Standard's ruthless growth brought out the ire of many damaged competitors and progressive campaigners, but none were fiercer than journalist Ida Tarbell, daughter to a failed oil entrepreneur Rockefeller had ruined in Ohio. Far greater attention was given to the behemoth trust following the publication of her book A History of the Standard Oil Company in 1904. Her accusations, which were not always economically accurate, spurred a federal investigation that led, two years later, to the filing of an antitrust suit against Standard Oil.
For five years, Standard's lawyers fought back hard against the government. Their primary argument was, essentially, "Yes, we're huge, but we did it legally." Later evaluations have determined that Standard's best growth success occurred entirely through normal business channels -- mergers, acquisitions, and geographic expansions -- and that Standard's pricing advantage came through this relentless growth and was not in fact predatory. Scale matters, and in resource extraction and refining it can make all the difference between phenomenal profitability and abject failure.
The Supreme Court waded into unknown economic territory and ultimately agreed that Standard Oil held an unreasonable monopoly over the rapidly expanding oil industry. The trust was given six months to disperse its operations to 34 "Baby Standards," which would then operate independently and generate the competitive pressure Standard Oil had not encountered. The largest of the Baby Standards would become:
A number of smaller Baby Standards would eventually go out of business or become acquisition targets of the larger post-split oil companies. Whether it was a result of competition or simply due to greater investor interest, the Baby Standards quickly boomed in value. At the end of 1911, the Baby Standards were worth a combined $600 million. A decade later, that value had swelled to $2.9 billion, representing an "unprecedented" quadrupling of value, according to a New York Times review of the companies' performance published at the end of 1921. By this point in time, the Baby Standards had paid out an incredible $920 million in dividends. This would be the equivalent of a $38 billion company paying out $12 billion in dividends over a decade today. Small wonder, then, that both Socal/Chevron and Esso/ExxonMobil joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) within the second decade of their dissolution -- the former in 1924 and the latter in 1928.
And small wonder that Rockefeller, the Standard Oil magnate, enjoyed one of the greatest expansions of wealth in his lifetime following the breakup. Rockefeller's soaring fortune led former President Theodore Roosevelt to later quip, "No wonder that Wall Street's prayer now is: 'Oh merciful Providence, give us another dissolution.'"
