After a strong January and a great first day of trading in February, stocks have plunged today. As of 3:15 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down 0.75%, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) has fallen 0.93%. The big economic news today was December's U.S. factory orders, which rose 1.8%, falling well short of the 2.3% increase economists had expected. When you strip out items like aircraft the nondurable goods, orders dropped 0.3%, showing a decline in spending by consumers. This may have been a short-term dip ahead of the fiscal cliff, but it certainly wasn't the news markets wanted to hear after such a strong start to 2013.
Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) has fallen 1.2% following the disappointing orders report. Economic reports have been spotty at best in recent weeks, and Alcoa will see an impact on operations if the U.S. and broader global economy don't start to recover more quickly in 2013.
The report has also pushed oil 1.6% lower today to $96.24. This didn't help shares of ExxonMobil or Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) today. The stocks are down 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively, and Chevron was also hit by a downgrade from "buy" to "neutral" by analysts at UBS. Oil has had a nice recovery on some hopeful economic reports, but we're losing some of that momentum as the black gold heads near $100 per barrel again.
One of the few bright spots today is Boeing (NYSE:BA
), which is up 0.77% on the day. Boeing is continuing work on the 787-9, which is slightly longer than the current 787, holds 40 more passengers, and travels slightly farther than the smaller aircraft. The company also announced a $350 million lawsuit against former Russian and Ukrainian partners in Sea Launch, a failed commercial satellite launching company. On the downside, All Nippon Airways said it is seeking damages for the 787s it owns that are currently grounded. This is the beginning of what could be hundreds of millions in costs associated with the grounding of Boeing's latest aircraft.

All through January, stocks have surged and sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) roaring toward record highs -- but don't look now, because the market's fortunes have taken a turn for the worse today. The index has dropped a glaring 120 points, or around 0.8%, as of 2:15 p.m. EST, pushed down by fresh concerns from Europe and a trio of Dow member downgrades. Nearly every stock on the index is currently in the red, with many suffering losses of more than 1%.
Europe, downgrades take a bite out of the Dow
Europe took the first crack at the markets today, with Spanish and Italian bond yields rising dramatically on bad news from the two debt-plagued countries. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has struggled to contain his country's spiraling unemployment problem, strongly denied accusations of corruption that sprung up over the weekend. In Italy, prosecutors have launched a probe of banks just as Silvio Berlusconi -- the former prime minister who is once again a candidate in elections -- vowed to cut taxes if elected. Markets didn't like any of this news, and with disappointing numbers today showing that new manufactured-goods orders in the U.S. rose less than expected in December, economic woes have investors reeling.
It's not just the economy at large, however; individual stocks on the Dow haven't been able to find any footing today, and downgrades have hit hard.
Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT
) has fallen 1.2% following a downgrade from analysts at JPMorgan, who cut the stock's recommendation from "outperform" to "neutral." The analysts cited the expiration of the payroll tax cut -- part of the fiscal-cliff deal -- as potentially stymying Wal-Mart's sales growth. While the retailer comes off of its 52-week highs, the fears are justified: During the height of the recession, reduced spending power among many consumers hit Wal-Mart sales hard, although the company has boosted sales at a quick clip since then.
More companies are feeling the downgrade pain today, though: Oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) has also fallen, with shares down 0.9% following a downgrade from "buy" to "neutral" courtesy of UBS analysts, who cited it as a value call. Chevron and fellow Dow oil giant Exxon-Mobil, which is also struggling today, could certainly benefit from the recent spike in gas prices. And while the two stocks have flirted with 52-week highs recently, these two companies are enjoying the afterglow of strong full-year 2012 earnings.
Shares of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK
) have taken the biggest hit of any downgraded company today, with the stock falling around 2%. Leerink Swann downgraded Merck from "outperform" to "market perform," citing a lack of near-term catalysts. Merck has indeed struggled with patent expirations on its best-selling drug Singulair recently, although the company still performed quite well through 2012. However, Merck did project profit to fall in 2013 as generic drugs continue to eat at sales of products that have lost patent protection, and the company's decision to delay filing for U.S. approval for its potential osteoporosis therapy odanacatib until 2014 hasn't helped investor sentiment.

Last Friday, when the Dow closed above 14,000 for only the 15th time ever, a number of market commentators were calling for a correction. Well, they didn't have to wait long for their predictions to come true. As of 12:45 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down 116 points, or 0.83%, to 13,893. Cisco is the only one of its 30 components trading higher. The other major indexes are also dropping, with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) down 0.92% and the NASDAQ down 1.2%.
So who's down and why?
Shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are down 1% after the stock was downgraded by analysts at UBS from "buy" to "neutral." Chevron has outperformed its industry peers over the past year, and the analyst is said to have based the downgrade on the stock's valuation, which has, in his opinion, gotten ahead of the stock price for now. UBS now has a price target of $120 for Chevron.
Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT
) was also downgraded this morning. JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers cut his rating from "outperform" to "neutral." He now believes the stock will trade in the neighborhood of $75 over the next year. The previous price target was set at $84 per share. Horvers gave a number of reasons for the downgrade, including growing pressure on the economy, his belief that sales have peaked after several years of strong growth, and the burden of the increased payroll tax on Wal-Mart customers. The company's shares are down 1.5% so far today.
It was announced earlier today that Japan Airlines and Boeing (NYSE:BA
) will discuss compensation for the airline's grounding of its fleet of 787 Dreamliners. Japan Airlines operates seven of the 50 Dreamliners that were grounded because of issues with the plane's battery system. The carrier is claiming that it will cost roughly $8 million for the planes to sit on the ground through the end of March. The airline wants to get the planes fixed and back in the air as quickly as possible, which it says will help with growing demand in European, North American, and Southeast Asian routes. Shares of Boeing are down 0.1% today.
