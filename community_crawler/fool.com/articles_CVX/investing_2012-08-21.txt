Iraq has once again returned to prominence as a dominant oil-producing country. Producing more than 3 million barrels of oil per day, the country has now overtaken Iran as the second largest OPEC producing nation. There's an estimated 143 billion barrels of oil in reserve, and large multinational oil firms are trying to secure contracts to drill for the black gold. However, after agreeing to deals in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, a number of big oil companies have an ultimatum -- either leave the Kurd region or be permanently restricted from Iraqi drilling auctions. Check out the video below for more information on the Iraqi oil landscape and the players involved.
