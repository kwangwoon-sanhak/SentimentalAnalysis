Transocean has made some ripples this past week in the investment industry with a billion dollar rig deal, as well as a potential lockout from the tremendous Brazilian oil and gas market. Investors applaud Transocean's decision to attack the lucrative ultra-deepwater rig market, which has helped offshore competitor Seadrill, but the sale of 38 shallow water rigs was done at a slight discount, accompanied by the grumble of stockholders. This week¡¯s deal is not close to having the long-term ramifications as would being permanently barred from operating in Brazil. Transocean and Chevron's appeal failed in allowing them to continue operating in the country after last year's 3,000 barrel oil spill. Check out the video below for more information on Transocean.
