The following video is part of our "Motley Fool Conversations" series, in which analyst John Reeves and advisor David Meier discuss topics around the investing world.
Energy stocks have had a rough go of it lately. John and David think there are some attractive ideas for the taking right now. The first one is Chevron. It's a global leader in oil, carries an attractive yield, and will continue to increase its dividend over time. The second is a natural gas leader, Devon Energy. David thinks the sector is getting interesting following Chesapeake Energy's sale of assets to Royal Dutch Shell. Devon has a wonderful portfolio of oil and gas properties that the market is discounting today. And finally, there's Spectra Energy. It owns more than 62,000 miles of pipeline that gather and transmit natural gas. The gas has to move, and Spectra makes it happen. If you're looking to increase your exposure to the energy sector, these three companies are a great way to do it.
There are many different ways to play the energy sector, and our analysts have uncovered an under-the-radar company that's dominating its industry.
