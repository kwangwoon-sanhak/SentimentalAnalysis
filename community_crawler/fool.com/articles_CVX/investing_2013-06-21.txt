Whenever shareholders see that their company is taking on debt, pitchforks and torches can be seen at the front door of corporate headquarters. Despite our investor aversion to debt, it isn't always a bad idea. Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is in a position to show just that. The company just completed a $6 billlion bond issuance that will be used to refinance some of its current debt structure. Chevron isn't alone, either, Rio Tonto (NYSE:RIO
) just did a similar bond move last week, and several other major American companies have done some big debt issuances in 2013.
Why are they doing it now? Debt is cheap. It's likely that the company wanted to make sure it got one last shot at cheap bonds ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting this week, which could decide the fate of the current quantitative easing program. In this video, Fool.com analysts Tyler Crowe and Aimee Duffy look at some of the reasons why these big debt buys are good for these companies.

) Angola LNG is one of the first ones to get there. Chevron just announced that it had shipped its first LNG cargo from the facility to Brazil last week. The addition of LNG provides producers something they haven't had in the domestic market there, demand for natural gas. 
Although this project is one of the first facilities to come online as LNG exports ramp up, it could be just the beginning for Africa LNG. Projects on the other side of the continent are finding massive quantities of natural gas, and LNG exports is the most likely market for it. In this video, Fool.com contributors Tyler Crowe and Aimee Duffy take a look at the potential for African natural gas and some of players in the space.
