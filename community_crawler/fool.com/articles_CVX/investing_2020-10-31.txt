Talking heads get paid to speculate about what the market will do in different scenarios, but it is rare that anyone can truly know how a particular company, industry, or the overall market will fare based on a presidential election. That said, a reelection of a U.S. President offers more certainty, because policies that have been put in place over the past four years are likely to continue.
Based on these last four years, not campaign rhetoric or partisan editorials, there are five stocks that stand to gain should President Donald Trump earn reelection in November. Let's see why Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK), and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) are poised to benefit.

As COVID-19 spread through the U.S. in the spring and summer, offices closed and family gatherings were cancelled. Many of us turned to Zoom to host events ranging from daily meetings, to virtual conferences, happy hours, and weddings.
Zoom came into 2020 on the heels of 88% sales growth in 2019. But the pandemic was rocket fuel for the company, spurring 355% growth in the second quarter to $633.5 million. In its Aug. 31 earnings call, the company projected only slight quarterly growth, expecting the demand for its services to wane as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had fallen sharply from the summer peak. But with cases, hospitalizations, and fear on the rise in many parts of the country, the fuel for the company's stratospheric rise is not totally spent.
The Trump administration's policies and pronouncements have embraced individual responsibility, protecting the most at-risk populations, and letting the virus run its course through healthier segments of the population. Experts agree that this approach, commonly referred to as seeking "herd immunity", will result in serious medical and financial consequences.
If the President is reelected, the current approach is likely to persist. For Zoom, more cases and hospitalizations mean more time before life returns to normal. The longer it takes to get back to normal, the more gains ahead for Zoom stock.
Part of President Trump's policy agenda in his first term has been to establish "American energy dominance." By eliminating regulations put in place to protect the environment, the oil and gas industry has been given the green light. In the past four years, pipelines that were put on hold have been resurrected, wildlife refuges opened up for drilling, data that track methane leaks are no longer collected, and auto emissions standards have been rolled back. 
It may come as no surprise that domestic oil production hit a record high in 2017, 2018 and 2019, topping over 17 million barrels per day last year. As the largest U.S. oil company, Chevron has been a beneficiary of the changes. The company currently lists large-scale exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian Basin, and a pending project in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain among its projects. With a focus on energy production and few environmental regulations left in the way, the source of Chevron's future profits becomes much clearer in a second Trump term. 
When the U.S. began setting tariffs on trade with China in July 2018, both countries took the posture of not backing down. Tariffs -- taxes levied on incoming goods -- are paid by the importers, thus eating into profit margins or increasing prices to ultimate users in the importing country. China, for its part, retaliated by cutting purchases of American agriculture. To make up for this, the Department of Agriculture doled out the highest level of farm subsidies in 14 years.
This windfall for farmers has helped spur Deere near its all-time highs. The stock is up 35% year to date, and with more than 40% of farm income set to come from government subsidies in 2020, the stock is set to continue its ascent under the Trump administration.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a 40% reduction. In reality, researchers at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) reviewed financial reports for 370 profitable corporations in the Fortune 500. They found that the effective tax rate -- what they actually paid -- went down from an average of 21.2% between 2008 and 2015 to just 11.3% in 2018.
In fact, despite the tax rate, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that, aside from Latvia, the U.S. corporate tax revenue as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the lowest in the industrialized world.
Of all the corporate winners, banks may have benefited the most, gaining not only from the reduction in tax rate, but also from a more preferable treatment of pass-through companies. A "pass-through" company is one that doesn't pay a portion of profits to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Instead, it passes those profits through the business, to the owner, who is now entitled to reduce the taxes on them by one-fifth. One-third of community banks in the U.S. are organized as pass-throughs and have realized the greatest benefits. A 2018 estimate from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) showed an additional $6.6 billion in profits to all of its member banks in the first quarter alone. 
One such bank is Bank OZK, the holding company that operates Bank of the Ozarks. Its real estate loan portfolio may be concentrated in larger COVID-19-exposed metropolitan areas, but the bank recently hiked its dividend for the 40th consecutive quarter. The loans on the books are high quality. The bank consistently has a lower percentage of charge-offs than the industry average. The bank also outperforms the industry in key measures of profitability.
AbbVie is the maker of the world's best-selling drug. Humira, a biologic, is a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, Crohn's disease, and plaque psoriasis, and raked in more than $19 billion in 2019. Humira accounts for 61% of the company's sales and, because it is considered a specialty drug, it is expensive for Medicare recipients. While Humira's total cost (insurance plus out-of-pocket) was estimated at more than $4,300 per month in 2019, a study found the out-of-pocket cost to someone with Medicare Part D insurance was still a whopping $5,200 annually. 
All politicians seem to agree that prescription drug prices are too high in the U.S., but little has been done to curb them. Joe Biden has proposed allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, among other initiatives. President Trump, for his part, has floated several ideas, but only recently finalized a policy for importing drugs from overseas in an attempt to lower prices. While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has had the authority to do this since 2000, the policy enacted in September excludes high-cost specialty drugs like Humira. 
If the President loses in November, the policies will almost certainly take on the pricing of AbbVie's flagship drug, among others. If the President is reelected, expect the company's sales and profits to flourish for at least the next four years. Humira's dominance has started to wane due to competition, but with $19 billion in annual sales, it will still be a while before Humira is dethroned.

*Stock Advisor returns as of May 11, 2021


Pierre Breber -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Wayne. Third-quarter earnings were about breakeven, improved from last quarter of reflecting continued challenging market conditions. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Special items totaled $220 million, including a tax charge related to a settlement agreement on asset retirement funding and other items tied to the expiration next August of the Rokan production sharing contract in Indonesia.
Free cash flow was almost $2 billion, and the dividend was flat with last quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow from operations improved as commodity prices increased from their lows in the second quarter. Included this quarter was a $265 million cash payment related to the Rokan settlement agreement.
Our cash flow dividend breakeven was under $50 Brent due to improved downstream performance and our strong capital and operating cost management. We ended the quarter with a net debt ratio over 17%, well below our competitors. Even after closing the Noble acquisition, and stepping up its step to fair value, we expect to maintain the leading balance sheet among the peer group. We're committed to protecting our financial strength during this ongoing crisis.
Turning to the next slide. Our 2020 capital spending is trending below our latest guidance. Looking ahead, we expect next year's capital budget to be $14 billion, below the combined 2020 guidance from Chevron and Noble, and well below Chevron's 5-year guidance from our March investor day. Our 2021 capital budget will continue to prioritize investments that drive long-term value and shows the capital flexibility in our portfolio, including assets recently added from Noble.
We'll share additional details in December after formal approval. Operating expenditures in the quarter were more than 10% lower than our 2019 quarterly average, ahead of our guidance. Turning to Slide 6. Relative to the same period last year, third-quarter adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower realizations and reduced liftings primarily due to curtailments, partially offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes and margins. The other segment was higher primarily due to various corporate charges. Turning to Slide 7. Compared to the second quarter, third-quarter earnings increased by about $8 billion.
More than half due to the absence of second-quarter special items. Adjusted upstream earnings were up almost $2 billion, primarily due to higher liquids realizations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased by over $1 billion primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins and favorable swings in both timing effects and lower cost or market inventory adjustments at CPChem. The other segment charges decreased primarily due to a favorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation.
Turning to production. Third-quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was 3% lower than a year ago. During the past 12 months, we closed a number of asset sales all signed pre-pandemic. Increased Permian production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and higher turnarounds.
The curtailments were in line with our guidance range and reflect mostly OPEC+ reductions in Kazakhstan and Africa and market-driven constraints in Thailand. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark Nelson -- Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals
Thanks, Pierre. As shown on Slide 9, the operating environment has improved from the lows in the second quarter but is still challenged. Some products like diesel and petrochemicals have been more resilient during the pandemic, and we've been able to develop new customer channels. Conversely, jet demand has only modestly recovered.
Its up-demand picture has resulted in weak product margins, well below cyclical averages. Since the crisis started, we've been focused on what we can control: safe and reliable operations, cost management, and value chain optimization. In the third quarter, our financial results improved due to strong performance in these areas, along with some margin improvement in polyethylene and West Coast fuels. Turning to the next slide.
Our focus on cost management is delivering results with third-quarter operating expenses nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I'm proud of how our employees have risen to this challenge. Streamlining work processes, reducing contractor costs, and adapting activity levels to a lower margin environment. Our teams have also delivered on more than 90% of the planned scope of our 2020 turnaround program.
Deferring only a minor amount of activity. This is a tremendous accomplishment and positions our refinery network to be ready without a backlog when the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels. Optimization activities further reduced the cost of this year's planned work, contributing to lower operating expenses. Turning to the next slide.
As always, we're focused on safe and reliable operations, keeping our employees safe, being a good neighbor, and delivering the products of the world are all part of our license to operate. Since the economic slowdown began, we've balanced efficient refinery utilization with the highest margin sales channels for our products. We've consistently placed more than 90% of our high-value products into our contracted sales channels despite volatility in demand. This generates the best margins across our value chains.
The recent acquisitions of marketing assets in Australia, in the Pasadena refinery, and the U.S. Gulf Coast further extend our value chains in those regions giving us more opportunities to improve profitability and returns. Turning to chemicals. GS Caltex continues to make good progress on their new mixed feed cracker.
We expect the project to be under budget and months ahead of schedule. Our local team has done a remarkable job safely progressing the project despite the challenges of COVID-19. At CPChem, we've completed feed at our U.S. Gulf Coast Cracker 2 project and have placed it on hold as we assess market conditions.
We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals, and the importance of world-scale facilities with access to low-cost feedstock. At the same time, any new investment needs to be supported by project economics that will generate strong returns through the price cycle. Also, CPChem began producing circular polyethylene at scale, an industry first in the United States. The production of PE from plastic waste is an important milestone and underscores our commitment to finding innovative ways to deliver sustainable products to our customers.
Now, turning to renewable fuels. The future of energy is lower carbon and we're delivering more alternative products to our customers. Recently, we announced first gas at our CalBio renewable natural gas joint venture in California and a new partnership with Brightmark. Our capital committed to RNG ventures is over $200 million.
In renewable diesel, we're leveraging existing infrastructure to co-process biofeed at our El Segundo refinery, with start-up expected in the first half of next year. Also, we sell a range of branded biodiesels and are piloting the sale of R99 in Southern California. Through Novvi, we recently announced first production of renewable base oil at our 500-barrel-a-day plant in Texas. This leading technology partnership has developed an innovative and sustainable product with future expansion potential.
And lastly, our GS Caltex hydrogen testing site in South Korea has opened, the first of its kind in Seoul, where customers can purchase traditional fuels, as well as hydrogen and electricity. All of these efforts align with how we're increasing renewables in support of our business, part of our approach to the energy transition, which Pierre will now further discuss.
Pierre Breber -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mark. We continue to make good progress in our energy transition focus areas. Next year, we expect to fund $100 million of projects identified with our marginal abatement cost curves. The map tool helps us select the most cost-efficient projects to reduce carbon intensity across our operations.
As Mark noted, we announced the new joint venture with Bright Mark, extending our renewable natural gas portfolio. Finally, in our partnership with Svante, we're pleased to have been awarded a U.S. DoE grant to help fund the construction of a demonstration carbon capture plant in our California upstream operations. The project is expected to start-up in 2022.
These projects reflect Chevron's commitment to low-carbon solutions that are both good for the environment and good for our shareholders. Turning to the next slide. We closed the Noble Energy acquisition earlier this month, and integration is on track. We've completed employee selections, had some early quick wins like paying off the revolver, and selling its plain, and assessment of operational opportunities is well on its way.
In the third quarter, Noble generated positive free cash flow primarily due to ongoing capital and cost management and strong sales in the Eastern Med. We're pleased to add Noble assets and welcome its talented employees to Chevron. Our internal transformation launched late last year is mostly complete with a new organization in place November first. This was an enterprisewide change effort, the largest since our Texaco merger, that modernizes how we work, leveraging digital tools and empowered teams.
Lastly, we recently signed an agreement to sell our Appalachia natural gas business. We expect to close the transaction before the end of the year. Now, looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect Noble production to be lower primarily due to seasonal demands in the Eastern Med. Curtailments and planned downtime are both lower than last quarter.
Production this quarter may include additional cost recovery barrels related to the Rokan settlement. At Gorgon, Train 2 weld repairs are now complete, and we have started commissioning in preparation for LNG production. We expect Train 1 to be taken out of service after Train 2 is back online. At TCO, remobilization continues.
We successfully increased the project workforce to near 15,000, and our plans are to end the year with a project team over 20,000. Earlier this week, we completed our final sea lift on schedule. All modules are now in Kazakhstan, a significant project milestone. And finally, we expect severance payments to lower cash flow.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.
Wayne Borduin -- General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. Keep in mind that we do have a full queue, so please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
We'll do our best to get to all of your questions answered. Audra, please open the lines.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good morning. I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark, i.e., sort on the downstream question, which is it looked like the downstream results, and particularly refining, surprised relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters, including on the West Coast? And just can you step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business?
Mark Nelson -- Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals
Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third-quarter performance overall, I would say that operationally, it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector. Also, some polyethylene in the West Coast fuels margin improvement. And then contribution from our lubricants and additives business.
If I step back and look at the refining sector, in general, I would say that the pandemic demand shock, clearly, has retested margin lows, and there's not a real analog for the pace of recovery. But the three things are required, I think, to have sustainable improved refining margins. First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials. We've certainly indicated that as an industry, we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 more gasoline/diesel levels.
But jet is still only half of 2019, and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization. This is the part that's interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing competitors start to do that.
In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia, and the U.S. Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And then, Pierre, follow-ups for you. It's on Gorgon.
Where do we stand with Train 2? And what do we know about Train 1 and 3 in terms of managing the downtime there?
Pierre Breber -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said, the weld repairs are complete. We verified them with nondestructive testing.
We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So we're now in the process of getting back online. So we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround. The next steps are to dry out the systems, and then we'll begin to cool down.
We expect this to take several weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of train one, as I said, we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1, and depending on whether repairs are required or not, that will determine how long Train 1 is down. And then sequentially, then we would look to Train 3 after that one.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
OK. Thanks, guys.

Good morning. I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark, i.e., sort on the downstream question, which is it looked like the downstream results, and particularly refining, surprised relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters, including on the West Coast? And just can you step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business?
Mark Nelson -- Executive Vice President of Downstream and Chemicals
Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third-quarter performance overall, I would say that operationally, it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector. Also, some polyethylene in the West Coast fuels margin improvement. And then contribution from our lubricants and additives business.
If I step back and look at the refining sector, in general, I would say that the pandemic demand shock, clearly, has retested margin lows, and there's not a real analog for the pace of recovery. But the three things are required, I think, to have sustainable improved refining margins. First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials. We've certainly indicated that as an industry, we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 more gasoline/diesel levels.
But jet is still only half of 2019, and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization. This is the part that's interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing competitors start to do that.
In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia, and the U.S. Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil.

Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And then, Pierre, follow-ups for you. It's on Gorgon.
Where do we stand with Train 2? And what do we know about Train 1 and 3 in terms of managing the downtime there?
Pierre Breber -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said, the weld repairs are complete. We verified them with nondestructive testing.
We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So we're now in the process of getting back online. So we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround. The next steps are to dry out the systems, and then we'll begin to cool down.
We expect this to take several weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of train one, as I said, we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1, and depending on whether repairs are required or not, that will determine how long Train 1 is down. And then sequentially, then we would look to Train 3 after that one.
