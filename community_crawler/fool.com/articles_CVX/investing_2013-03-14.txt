More strong employment data is pushing stocks higher again today. The Department of Labor said initial jobless claims fell 10,000 to 332,000 last week, below the 350,000 estimate. Only one weekly reading has been this low in the past five years, which is another positive sign for the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) responded by rising 0.44% by 3:20 p.m. EDT, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) was up 0.43%.
Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) has risen 1.3% to a new 52-week high today. The gain comes a day after a liquid-natural-gas pipeline the company owns in Louisiana burst into flames when a tugboat ran into it. Four people were injured in the incident, but it doesn't appear to be a major spill, at least as far as gas spills go. The fire continues to burn, but Chevron was able to shut off the flow, so the worst will be over once the LNG in the pipeline is burned. Investors are clearly looking past this incident today and focusing on strong economic numbers even as oil prices rise, which is great for oil companies.
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) is up 1.8% today after sealing a deal to supply servers for the European Commission. HP's server and services businesses have been supporting the company as sales of PCs and printers slowly dwindle. After being beaten down last year, HP's stock will jump on any good news about the economy or the company's sales. Slow and steady wins the race, and HP is getting back to business as usual, which is good for investors in the long term.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO
) is up 1.1% today after being upgraded by analysts at CLSA. It doesn't hurt that unemployment claims were down, which should mean more money in the pockets of consumers to buy Coke and all of the other goodies the company makes.

The wealth-building power of compound interest will never cease to amaze me. It's a story of patience and attention to detail, where small, short-term differences add up to massive divergence over decades. And in the end, the biggest winners don't always deliver the fattest share-price returns.
Let's take a closer look at the dividend-paying habits of diversified energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX
). The stock has crushed fellow energy titan ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and the wider Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) over the last decade. This is true whether or not you assume dividends were reinvested into buying more stock along the way, but the payouts sure boost your total returns by a welcome margin.

CVX DATA BY YCHARTS.
It's hard to complain about a 275% 10-year return, which works out to an annual gain of 13.9%. The Dow's rise over the same period was a far smaller 83% jump, or 6.2% annualized.
But throw in the reinvested-dividends effect, and Chevron's return swells to a mighty 413% -- a 17.8% compound average growth rate. The Dow's average return under the same circumstances only rose to 8.8% per year.
Viewed through another lens, Chevron's payouts boosted its total returns by 50%, while the average Dow stock's payouts only added 33%. Exxon actually lags its blue-chip peers in this department, because its dividends only juiced total returns by 25%.
The secret to Chevron's shareholder-friendly success? Relentless payout increases. Share prices have been rising sky-high, but management kept pace with equally fantastic dividend boosts. The result: surprisingly steady dividend yields through thick and thin.

The amazing run of record highs for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) appears poised to continue today as the market responds favorably to data showing fewer unemployment claims and a lack of inflationary pressure at the wholesale level. As of 10:55 a.m. EDT, the Dow is up 58 points, or 0.4%, to break through the 14,500 mark. The broader market is up similarly on a percentage basis.
Given the way the Dow is calculated, high-priced stocks have the most influence, and that's where the gains are coming from today. IBM (NYSE:IBM
) rose a seemingly modest 1.4%, but its rise accounted for more than 20 points of the Dow's gain. Investors appear to be increasingly optimistic about the tech giant's move into the cloud-computing arena through its Big Data initiative, focusing on bringing more medium-sized businesses into the trend toward cloud-based enterprise software. Given the speed of the trend, IBM could use the initiative as a major part of its drive toward boosting earnings per share to $20 within the next two years.
Meanwhile, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) gained 1.3%, accounting for more than 10 points of the Dow's rise. As of this morning, a fire that occurred when a tugboat struck a Chevron gas pipeline was continuing to burn. Yet the news hasn't kept the stock from setting new record highs, with the potential of an expansion of California-based hydraulic fracturing potentially providing a much-needed boost to Chevron's domestic resources.
Outside the Dow, earnings news dominated the gainers. Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX
) soared 8.5% after the insurance support company announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter results this morning. Yet long-term investors should focus more on the huge opportunity that Obamacare offers the company as millions of new customers tax the systems that insurance companies have in place to track them, pushing more of those companies to bring on Ebix as a partner to help support their operations.
Finally, Flotek (NYSE:FTK
) has gained 8.5%. Earnings came in better than expected, with net income nearly doubling for the full 2012 year compared to 2011. Given all the activity going on in the energy industry, Flotek is set to continue offering drilling products and production-enhancement technology well into the future.
