Even though the stock market has been the greatest long-term creator of wealth for investors, bonds have also earned their seat at the table. Buying a bond usually gives investors a nearly guaranteed rate of return that they can expect over a well-defined time frame. This certainty is what's made U.S. Treasury bonds an especially popular investment over the years.
However, today's Treasury Bonds are a far cry from year's past. Right now, a 10-year note will only net investors an annual yield of about 1.65%, which is actually lower than both the Federal Reserve's target inflation rate of 2%, and the 1.8% actual inflation rate over the trailing-12-month period. In other words, income seekers buying T-bonds would make money on a nominal basis, but they'd be losing money on a realized basis, when taking inflation into account.

Here are three brand-name dividend stocks for income investors to consider buying instead of low-yielding bonds.
The phrase "boring is beautiful" might as well have been invented to describe AT&T's (NYSE:T) business model. As a telecom and content giant, AT&T's high-growth days have long since passed. But that hasn't stopped the dominant telecom provider from raking in the dough over the years, or ensuring that its shareholders enjoy the spoils of its slow but steady growth. Last December, AT&T increased its payout for the 35th consecutive year, making it one of a select few S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. The company is currently paying out a 5.4% yield.
