The following video is part of our "Motley Fool Conversations" series, in which analyst John Reeves and advisor David Meier discuss topics across the investing world.
Over the next couple of weeks, John and David will be revisiting some calls they made on individual stocks of the Dow. Today, they're checking out ExxonMobil. This company is slightly positive in 2012 compared with a roughly 4% gain for the Dow average as a whole. John and David thought ExxonMobil would outperform the Dow over the next five years. Like its Dow counterpart, Chevron, ExxonMobil has a vast array of energy assets and is one of the best-run energy companies in the world. Its acquisition of XTO Energy made it the largest domestic natural gas producer, surpassing Chesapeake Energy. Despite the recent pullback, John and David still think ExxonMobil will outperform the index over the next five years, and they own shares of the company in their real-money portfolio.
