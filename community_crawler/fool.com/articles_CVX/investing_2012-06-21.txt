Yesterday's Federal Reserve announcement and news conference turned out to be largely a non-event, especially for those looking for innovative proposals to jump-start a flagging economy. After trying to rebound from yesterday's losses, the stock market this morning gave up its gains and turned lower, as a host of news appeared to confirm worries about economic growth around the world. Although Spain managed to get some much-needed sovereign debt auctioned off, weakness in the manufacturing sectors in both China and Germany appear troubling. By 10:45 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrials (INDEX: ^DJI) were down 14 points to 12,810 after having fallen as much as 40 points earlier in the day.
Merck (NYSE: MRK) rose more than 1% after reports from Indian news sources that the company may be looking to buy privately held Micro Labs, an Indian company that makes pharmaceutical ingredients. With the future of health care in the U.S. uncertain, Merck and its peers are increasingly looking to emerging markets like India for potential growth opportunities. It's unlikely, though, that an acquisition this small would have this large an impact on Merck.
Alcoa (NYSE: AA), on the other hand, fell almost 2%. Clearly, weakness in the manufacturing sector strikes near the core of Alcoa's business. Investors are also getting impatient with the aluminum maker, with a lawsuit coming earlier this week from a shareholder who said that the company didn't adequately look into bribery allegations. For Alcoa to start performing well, it badly needs signs of global economic weakness to go away.
Finally, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) were both lower as oil continued its recent plunge. Crude is now approaching the $80-per-barrel level, as investors fear a loss of demand if industrial activity truly does begin to slow. The declines in both stocks have been less severe than crude's moves, however, suggesting at least some belief that oil could rebound in the near future.

Not that it's any secret, but the state of the global economy isn't exactly rosy these days. But only a day after the Fed concluded its monetary policy meetings with noteworthy lack of further quantitative easing, another spate of negative data has painted the U.S. recovery a growing weaker by the day. U.S. stocks markets don't like it, either.
Coming into midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEX: ^DJI) finds itself trading 0.7% lower. Probably unsurprisingly, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 slumped 1.2% and 1%, respectively, as well. The market's "fear gauge," or the VIX (INDEX: ^VIX), gained 6.6% as well halfway through today's trading session.
The devil's in the details
As mentioned above, today's bad news came from stateside. News from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed manufacturing activity in its region (basically the mid-Atlantic) declined. The news came after a similar survey showed manufacturing also dwindled in the New York area. Additionally, May used-home sales figures also declined. Individually, these figures carry little weight. However, taken as a whole, they paint U.S. recovery as increasingly tepid, which of course has investors concerned, as growth prospects have also soured in China and Europe.
As should be expected, the bad news sent cyclical stocks sharply downward. Shares of aluminum producer Alcoa (NYSE: AA) dropped 2.7%. After rallying strongly to start the year, Alcoa's stock has fallen more than 13% in the last three months. The negative economic outlook has oil and oil-related stocks retreating. Currently oil finds itself down 1.6% around noontime.  At present, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) sit 1.3% and 1.8% lower, respectively.  However, these large-cap Dow components have fared better than their respective sectors, which are the two worst-performing market sectors today; both the broader basic materials sector and energy sector have each dropped 2.2% today. Ouch.
As was the case above, large-cap stocks can afford more safety to investors, which could make them solid candidates if global growth continues to sour.

It's been a day of steady declines as poor economic data came out. Initial claims improved, but are still a far cry from good, and the U.S. manufacturing sector showed slowing growth. It's a better showing than China, which saw its manufacturing shrink this month. And new data confirms the eurozone's contracting economy is as bad as you think. Enter Goldman Sachs, which seemingly gave the markets a push over the edge after recommending investors short S&P 500.
That said, let's take a closer look at how the three major indexes are faring.

The major U.S. indexes have given up ground all day, with the Nasdaq leading the charge into negative territory. All of today's chaos has the market's "fear index" soaring back in a big way; the VIX (NYSE: ^VIX) is up over 10% today, at least temporarily breaking out of its seemingly never-ending decline. With the Federal Reserve content to merely maintain the status quo, we may be in for a long summer.
No sector is getting hammered as badly as energy today. Even the big names are feeling it: Dow components ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are two of the index's worst performers, down 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Small players like Kodiak Oil & Gas (NYSE: KOG) are feeling it worse. Its shares are down 7%, as lower oil prices have a greater impact due to the company's higher-cost operations. If global economies are cooling -- and China's manufacturing decline is probably the most troublesome news here -- then commodities will see less demand. Oil has dropped under $80 per barrel for the first time since last fall, and the average price at the pump -- currently $3.47 per gallon -- is expected to continue to decline even into the summer months.
Oil companies are not without their ups and downs due to the cyclicality of their business, but dividends compensate investors all year long. The Dow is loaded with companies with solid dividend payouts and highly sustainable business models built for the long haul.

Just yesterday, Federal Reserve decided it would take the less-direct approach of supporting the economy by continuing Operation Twist. Ben Bernanke also explained that policymakers are prepared to take additional steps to help the economy if the situation worsens. Well, that coupon might need to be cashed sooner rather than later, as the broad markets are plummeting along with crude oil prices.

The global economy is springing leaks all over the place, as manufacturing is slowing, hurting both emerging and developed nations. Stocks and commodities plunged due to reports showing business activity across the eurozone shrinking yet again, extending the streak to five straight months. To compound the problem, manufacturing in China is expected to contract at levels not seen since the global financial crisis, according to HSBC Holdings. With telling signs of a global economy ailing coupled with Fed officials lowering the GDP growth outlook for 2012, investors decided to move into the safety of U.S. Treasuries.
With money shifting into benchmark 10-year notes, let's take a look at the sectors experiencing heavy sell-offs.
Energy
It is no surprise that energy is taking a splash, as this sector is highly cyclical and its performance is closely aligned with economic growth. In the Dow, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) are pushing a 3% drop as both West Texas Intermediate and international Brent crude prices are getting slammed. Typically, big oil can ride out days where crude plummets, but when both U.S. and global prices tank, the diversified oil companies join the fold and get punished as well.
Technology
Red Hat (NYSE: RHT) shares are falling, down 5.5%, due to weak performance and a disappointing outlook. The open-source Linux and software provider reported billing revenue growth of 16%, failing to meet analyst expectations of 20% to 22%. To make matters worse, the company is expecting revenue for this next quarter to drop from $330 million to $320 million.
Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is down 2.73% due to poor economic news, especially slowing Chinese growth. Qualcomm has increasingly relied on China as its source of revenue growth; it currently supplies over 30% of sales. China's slowing growth will adversely affect Qualcomm, as the computer chip maker relies on smartphone growth, collecting 3% to 5% of the wholesale price for CDMA devices.
Takeaway
Today is a perfect example of how quickly good news can be discarded. The past week the markets increased on expectations of the Fed boosting the economy through extended stimulus measures.

After the Federal Reserve decided not to take extraordinary measures to try to rescue investors, the stock market seemed to realize the full import of all the challenges it currently faces. Between slowing emerging market economies, huge uncertainties in Europe, and growing concerns in the U.S, the last thing stocks needed was a bearish call from Goldman Sachs recommending that its clients sell the S&P 500 (INDEX: ^GSPC) short. In response, markets plunged, with the Dow Jones Industrials (INDEX: ^DJI) falling more than 250 points, and other major market indexes losing between 2% and 3% on the day.
But are investors overstating the importance of Goldman's bear call? Looking more closely at its recommendation, Goldman suggested shorting the S&P with a target of 1285, about 5% below where the market opened the day, and roughly corresponding to the lows that the index hit in May. Even if Goldman's prediction comes to pass, it would still leave the market with a gain on the year.
More importantly, anyone who expects to put more money into the market than they're going to take out over the next year or two should want stocks to fall. Already, Dow components Chevron (NYSE: CVX), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) are among the dozens of large-cap stocks offering earnings yields of 10% or more, and a further decline in the market could allow many other stocks to join them. Moreover, every percent the market falls gives you a better chance to grab a huge long-term value with an additional margin of safety.
Don't be afraid
Don't let Goldman's bearish call make you scared. Instead, look at it as helping you get a big opportunity to increase your returns.
Throughout history, smart investors have taken advantage of bearish conditions to make huge profits.
