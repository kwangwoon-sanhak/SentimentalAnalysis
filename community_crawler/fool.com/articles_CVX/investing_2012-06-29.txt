Oil and gas dominate the South American energy picture. Venezuela is home to the world's largest oil reserves, and Brazil's pre-salt offshore fields are one of the more compelling plays in the world right now. With virtually no nuclear presence on the entire continent, expect oil and gas, along with coal, to dominate energy production in the near future.
Renewables
Renewable energy has a presence in South America, but in light of giant oil discoveries in recent years, the future growth of the industry is anything but predictable. Brazil, once the world leader in biofuels production, gave up its crown to the U.S. in 2006 and has been trailing ever since. Though it remains a world leader, and tops South America by far, biofuels production dropped 15% from 2010 to 2011. Brazil also leads the continent in hydropower generation.
Chile may wind up being the renewables champion on the continent. The country's fossil fuel production isn't particularly impressive, and renewable energy is its only shot at generating power domestically. Though hydro power meets 40% of Chile's electricity needs, 75% of all energy demand is answered by imported fossil fuels. Right now, renewables only meet 4% of Chile's overall energy needs. The country hopes to increase that number to 20%, not including hydro power, by 2020.
Coal
South America's coal story overall isn't especially compelling.
Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela have the only significant coal reserves on the continent. The 11.8 billion tons only comprise 1.4% of the world's total, however. Colombia leads the way in production with an output of 55.8 million tons in 2011. Venezuela and Brazil followed with 6.3 million and 2.4 million tons, respectively.
Oil
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but by most accounts its national oil company, PDVSA, is a mess, and consistently underachieves from a production standpoint.
Overall, the continent holds its own in the world oil game. Here is a snapshot of the region's production from 2011:

The story here is Colombia. The country ratcheted up oil production from 529,000 barrels a day in 2006 to 914,000 bpd last year. In an effort to reach its goal of 1 million bpd, the country plans to auction off rights to 115 oil and natural gas blocks this year, presenting an intriguing opportunity for foreign investment.
Natural gas
While Venezuela has the largest natural gas reserves, Argentina is the South American country that produces the most natural gas. The country pumped out 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2010, placing it among the top 25 globally. The country also has what are believed to be the third-largest shale gas reserves in the world, after China and the United States, totaling 774 tcf.
Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Colombia round out the top five producers on the continent.
While most regions limit the fossil fuel to electricity generation, South America has incorporated it into its transportation infrastructure. There are currently more than 4 million vehicles in service on the continent that run on natural gas, compared to around 125,000 in the United States.
Geopolitical risk
Significant reserves and compelling plays like Brazil's pre-salt fields make South America a tempting locale for energy investment. Doing business with National Oil Companies, however, leaves a lot to be desired.
Take Chevron's (NYSE: CVX) recent experience in Brazil, for example. Last November, the company reported a small spill in the Frade field 230 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Chevron acted quickly to stop the leaking well and contain the oil on the surface. The situation was resolved within four days and, while estimates put the spill at around 3,000 barrels, no oil ever reached the shores of Brazil.
A month later, however, the situation blew up as a Brazilian federal prosecutor named Chevron in what would be the first of multiple billion dollar lawsuits. Employees of the company were not allowed to leave the country, and were facing criminal charges.
In April, a federal judge denied a request that Chevron suspend all of its operations in Brazil. Reason may ultimately prevail, but not before expensive litigation and the loss of production from the entire Frade field, which Chevron voluntarily shut down.
As other world regions look to diversify their power sources, India's biggest energy flaw may be its transmission and distribution network. Estimates put average annual electricity losses at 27%; losing that much power off the grid costs India billions of dollars a year, and ultimately inhibits the country from moving forward in its energy development. Power outages and blackouts are frequent, and 400 million people, about one-third of the population, live without electricity.
Renewables
The world of renewables is pretty small in India. The country accounted for just 4.7% of consumed renewable energy in 2011, its consumption largely comprised of biofuels and wind.
The government plans to increase India's renewable power generation, specifically hydro power, which currently provides 12% of the country's electricity. But as the EIA notes, the country's transmission and distribution capabilities are limited, making renewable expansion that much more of a challenge.
Nuclear
India has 20 power plants that generate about 4.4 GW of electricity. The country has seven more plants currently under construction that will more than double that output. The country's goal is to generate 50% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050. Fossil fuels currently provide 80% of the country's electricity.
Coal
India produced 622 million short tons of coal in 2010, but, similar to essentially all of India's energy sources, the country consumes more coal than it produces. India consumed over 721 million short tons in 2010. Both of India's top coal suppliers, Coal India and Tata Power, regularly import millions of tons of coal to cover the shortfall.
And yet, the country has had to deal with power deficits as high as 4.3 GW because of coal shortages. In fact, there is one going on right now! Some analysts expect it to be double what it was two years ago. As a result, Indian coal companies are scrambling to secure coal assets abroad.
Oil
India's oil reserves stand at about 5.7 billion barrels. In 2010, India produced 750,000 barrels of crude per day, but consumed 3.2 million bpd, once again relying heavily on imports to make up the difference. It was the world's fifth largest importer of oil in 2010, with the majority of supply coming from Saudi Arabia and Iran.
In an effort to ramp up production, the Indian government has attempted to deregulate the oil industry and encourage foreign investment. Nevertheless, the dominant player is the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp., which was responsible for three-quarters of India's oil production in 2010.
Also of note: At 4 million barrels of crude per day, the country has the fifth largest refining capacity in the world.
Natural gas
Estimates for India's natural gas reserves range from 38 trillion cubic feet to 44 TCF. The EIA estimates that the country produced 1.8 TCF in 2010, but consumed around 2.3 TCF. India made up the difference with 429 BCF in imports that year. In fact, the country has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004. The majority of the country's LNG comes from Qatar into two LNG import terminals. Two more terminals are scheduled to come online this year.
Geopolitical risk
Unlike many governments worldwide that are tightening restrictions on exploration and production, India is paring back regulation to encourage foreign investment. BP (NYSE: BP) signed up, but so far that investment hasn't been worth the price tag. India's domestic assets are not the most sought-after to begin with.
Companies that rely on India as an export market also need to be very careful. Though the country looks poised to remain completely dependent on imports for the near future, any economic collapse will drive down the demand for foreign energy.
Additionally, the country's emphasis on building a nuclear power program, and possible electricity imports from Iran, may contribute to weaker demand for imported energy.
Players
Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU)
Peabody coal fuels 2% of the world's electricity. India was the fastest-growing coal importer in 2011, and the two seemed to be destined for each other, though perhaps they will never be as close as India might like: Coal India was in talks to establish a joint venture at a Peabody mine in Australia last year, but negotiations fell through.
Total (NYSE: TOT)
Total has a 26% stake in the Hazira regasification LNG terminal. The import facility has a capacity of 177 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year. Total also agreed to provide 26% of the LNG for Hazira.
Reliance Industries
Reliance is part of parent conglomerate Reliance Group, and is India's largest private company. Most of the company's business is focused on domestic offshore blocks, but in recent years, the company has made more of an effort to build up an international presence. It is currently working with three companies in two U.S. shale plays. It is partnered with Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Carrizo Oil & Gas (Nasdaq: CRZO) on two separate projects in the Marcellus shale, and Pioneer Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford shale.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp
As stated earlier, ONGC is the dominant player on the Indian oil and gas scene. How much longer there will be an Indian oil and gas scene is becoming an increasingly pertinent question. Oil production has been declining for years, and the company has not brought any new fields on line. In May, the company's production declined 4.1% on the year to 452,300 barrels per day.
BP
Last year, BP coughed up $7 billion for a 30% stake in several of Reliance Industries' offshore natural gas blocks. Over one year later, its partner Niko Resources announced the reserves at block D6 -- the only producing block -- are probably two-thirds smaller than originally anticipated.

Japan and Korea have very little in the way of natural resources; energy imports dominate their consumption patterns and the two countries remain important players on the world energy scene.
Renewables
Last year's earthquake, tsunami, and ensuing disaster at Japan's Fukushima power plant drastically altered the country's future energy outlook. Once planning to increase nuclear capacity, Japan is now looking to replace nuclear power wherever possible. The country is heavily dependent on costly imports, leaving the door wide open for the growth of renewables. Japan's government is expected to officially put in place an act that encourages utilities to buy renewable energy at fixed feed-in tariff prices sometime this summer.
As of last summer, South Korea is home to the world's largest tidal power installation. The plant's capacity is 254 MW. The country is also exploring the possibility of adding two more plants with capacities of 480 MW and 1 GW, respectively.
Korea is also pursuing wind power, recently signing on with the United Kingdom to establish the U.K.-Korea Ocean Energy Technology Cooperation Project. The U.K. is the world's offshore wind leader; Korea is looking to grow its presence and has 2,500 MW of wind power currently in development.
Nuclear
Korea has 23 nuclear reactors generating 20.7 GW of electricity and expects to increase its nuclear program so that it provides 59% of the country's power by 2030.
Japan used to be the third largest nuclear power generating nation in the world, but after last year's Fukushima disaster, the country's output has fallen to zero. Prior to the disaster, nuclear power accounted for 13% of Japan's electricity generation. The country has relied more heavily on fossil fuel imports to account for the lack of nuclear power since last March.
Coal
Japan is the second largest importer of coal in the world, after China; Korea is third.
In 2011, Coal accounted for 43% of fossil fuel generated power in Japan. The country stopped producing coal in 2002, relying solely on imports since. In 2010, Japan imported 207 million short tons of coal.
Korea has minimal coal reserves, and domestic production tops out around 3 million short tons a year. Consumption, and therefore imports, has increased steadily since 2005 and is now over 120 million short tons a year.
Oil
In 2011, Japan's oil production was 130,000 barrels per day, but only 5,000 barrels were crude oil. Not surprisingly, Japan is the third largest importer of oil in the world, importing 4.3 million barrels per day. The country's oil companies have also made a serious effort to grow its global exploration and development footprint, establishing joint ventures in virtually every region of the world.
Korea has the sixth largest refining capacity in the world, but with no domestic reserves it relies solely on imports to meet demand. Its largest oil company, Korea National Oil Corporation, is active overseas, and has recently begun to explore offshore Korea for potential drilling locations.
Natural gas
Japan and Korea rank first and second in the world for LNG imports. Japan alone accounts for 33% of the world LNG market. The country has natural gas reserves of about 738 billion cubic feet at the beginning of this year, which is half of what they were five years ago. Japan consumed 3.7 TCF of gas in 2010, importing 3.4 TCF. Imports popped 12% to 3.8 TCF after Fukushima.
Korea Gas is the largest single LNG importer in the world. The country covers 1.3% of demand with production from its one offshore gas field, and imports the rest. Korea consumed 1.5 TCF in 2010, a 25% increase from the year before when demand was weak in light of the recession.
Geopolitical risk
The majority of the risk here is in shrinking, or changing, demand. In one year, Japan went from being the world's third biggest generator of nuclear power to generating no nuclear power at all. At some point some of the reactors will be brought back online, but ultimately the country would like to move away from nuclear power and that will affect uranium exporters.
LNG exporters also rely heavily on this market. A rapid conversion to renewable energy or electricity imports would leave exporters with a big hole to fill on their balance sheets.
Finally, simply the location of South Korea is a risk. North Korea is a ticking time bomb, who knows what could happen there.
Players
Korea Electric Power (NYSE: KEP)
Korea's electric utility has several subsidiaries that manage the country's various power sources, including nuclear, hydro, and thermal. The company is active abroad, taking equity stakes in mines and establishing joint ventures to secure future energy supply. It has acquired at least a stake in projects in Australia, Indonesia, and Canada.
KEPCO does not boast great profit margins, but shares have performed well recently on expectations that margins will improve when the government increases electricity prices in July.
Samsung Heavy Industries
Samsung Heavy is one of the major players in Korean shipyards. The company builds drill ships, container ships, and LNG carriers and is a crucial component in the world energy picture. The company will be increasingly relevant in the coming years as offshore drilling ramps up in the Arctic. Samsung has built the first Arctic Shuttle-Tanker, and developed Arctic Ice-Breaker container ships.
Mitsubishi (OTC: MSBHY.PK)
The Japanese trading company has been busy over the past year trying to secure LNG supply. Earlier this year, the company signed a deal with Encana to develop its Cutbank Ridge assets in British Columbia. Mitsubishi paid $2.9 billion for a 40% stake in over 400,000 acres.
The company also has a 20% share in an LNG export project in Kitimat, British Columbia. Mitsubishi has partnered with Shell, PetroChina, and Korea Gas to construct a facility with export capacity of 12 million metric tons.
BP (NYSE: BP)
BP has a fairly diverse presence in Korea, providing lubricants, LNG, petrochemicals, and PV solar cells and modules. The company also buys numerous vessels from Korean shipyards, including tankers, LNG carriers, and drill ships. The company has been in Korea for 30 years.
Chevron (NYSE: CVX)
Chevron is the operator of two new LNG terminals in Australia that are both scheduled to come online in the next five years. The new projects are so crucial to Japan's energy future that Tokyo Electric Power just bought an equity stake in one of them. TEPCO will buy an 8% stake in the Wheatsone LNG facility, and has increased its total deliveries from the plant to 4.3 million tons per year.
Chevron also has a Wheatstone LNG purchase commitment from another Japanese utility, Tohuku Power.

Australia is a hotbed for natural resources, particularly fossil fuels used to generate energy. The country exports nearly two-thirds of its energy production, ranking first in the world in coal exports and fourth for liquefied natural gas exports.
Renewables
Renewables exist in Australia, but not on a meaningful scale. The country increased its solar capacity more than 135% in 2011 to 1,345 megawatts, just shy of 2% of the global total. The country's wind capacity at the end of 2011 was much higher, at 2,476 MW, but that only accounts for 1% of the global total. When it's all said and done, fossils fuels account for 95% of Australia's energy consumption and 92% of electricity generation.
Australia has a goal to produce 20% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2020. Ambitious yes, but Australia's incentive to reach the goal is higher than in other places. The country generates more pollution per person than any other developed nation -- including the United States.
Nuclear
As of 2010, Australia was estimated to hold just under half of the world's recoverable uranium resources. Somewhat inexplicably, the country does not have a single nuclear reactor. Two of the world's largest mining companies, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) are headquartered in the country; both produce uranium.
Coal
Over the past 20 years, coal production in Australia has increased nearly 100%. The country is the world's fourth-largest producer, and the No. 1 exporter. Australia produced 449 million short tons of coal in 2010, and exported about 322 MMST of that. Top destinations for Australian coal are Japan (43%), South Korea (15%), China (14%), and India (11%).
Oil
Australia is not a big player on the world oil scene. Its proved reserves are estimated at 3.32 billion barrels, and production in 2011 averaged just over 464,000 barrels a day. Though it doesn't have much oil, it does have the sort of oil that everyone wants. Australian crude is a low-sulfur light crude that is easy and cheap to refine, and thus more desirable than heavy crudes.
Natural gas
Natural gas is crucial to Australia's future. The country has proven reserves of 110 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the 12th-largest in the world. Those are just conventional resources; Australia also has an estimated 396 TCF of shale gas reserves. Natural gas production reached 1.6 TCF in 2010 and is expected to increase four times over by 2035.
Australia is the world's fourth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. LNG exports brought in $10.5 billion in 2010-11, an increase of 34% over the previous year. With at least two major LNG export facilities slated to come online in the next five years, expect that number to increase.
Geopolitical risk
Australia is really as innocuous as it gets. Unlike many regions of the world, there are no nationally owned energy companies here. The government has no stake in the oil and gas industry, which limits risk for foreign companies targeting Australian resources.
Similar to the U.S., Australian states have the ability to govern energy production in their territory, to a point.  In theory, this set up could affect energy development on a case-by-case, regional basis.
Finally, Australia relies heavily on exporting energy to economies in Asia. If that market faced a significant downturn, the effect on Australia would be tremendous. Conversely, growing energy demand in that region could buoy export revenues to new levels.
Players
Chevron (NYSE: CVX)
Chevron is a dominating player in Australia's LNG business. The company is the operator of two LNG export facilities currently under construction. The Gorgon project on Barrow Island, off the northwest coast of Australia, is expected to come online in 2014. The Wheatstone facility, also off the coast of Western Australia, is expected to go into production in 2016.
Apache (NYSE: APA)
Apache has been in Australia since the early 1990s. In 2011, the company produced 38,228 barrels of oil per day, and 185,079 cubic feet of natural gas per day. The company's estimated proven reserves are 330 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Perhaps most importantly, Apache has a 13% stake in Chevron's Wheatstone LNG export facility.
BHP Billiton
BHP Billiton operates the largest individual coal production site in New South Wales. The Mount Arthur coal mine produces 20 million tons each year. The company expects its expansion plans to increase that number to 24 million tons.
The company mines uranium at its Olympic Dam mine in South Australia. The mine is the largest known uranium deposit in the world. BHP recently purchased four exploration licenses for $3 million for acreage surrounding the mine.
Rio Tinto
Severe weather in Australia affected production at each of Rio Tinto's four Queensland mines in 2011. However, high prices for coal led to $1.24 billion in earnings for its Australian coal sector, which was a 32% increase over 2010. The company expects coal production to increase in 2012 via expanded capacity at its mines. Expansion projects should also increase its output of uranium.
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-B)
Shell is pushing the LNG envelope with its implementation of a floating LNG facility. FLNG allows gas to be produced and processed in remote offshore locations, as the FLNG facility sits right above the field. Last spring, Shell's board gave the go-ahead on the project. Once constructed, the Prelude FLNG facility will be the largest floating structure ever built. The company has not alluded to the cost or completion date for the structure, but it can be noted that production in the prelude field is slated to begin in 2017.
