Stocks rose in a low-volume session Friday as investors looked forward to earnings reports in coming weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) traded in narrow range and closed with nice gains. Financials climbed in the wake of a strong report from JPMorgan Chase; healthcare was the only sector to lose ground.

Chevron surprised Wall Street with a $50 billion cash-and-stock offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, in a bid to bolster its position in oil production in U.S. shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko's shares shot up 32% to $61.78 on the news and those of Chevron slipped 4.9% to $119.76.
The deal is structured as 75% stock and 25% cash, with the oil and gas giant paying $16.25 in cash and 0.3869 newly issued Chevron shares for every Anadarko share. That values Anardarko stock at $62.60 based on closing prices today.
If the transaction wins Anadarko shareholder approval, Chevron will add to its leading position in the fast-growing Permian Basin and acquire attractive acreage in Colorado's DJ Basin. Anadarko also has complementary deepwater wells in the Gulf, liquefied natural gas facilities in Mozambique, and a strategic stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP, whose units soared 8.4% today.
The companies expect $1 billion in operating cost savings and another $1 billion savings in capital expenditures. The deal triggered speculation of a new round of consolidation in energy companies, lifting shares of potential acquisition targets.
Disney unveiled its Disney+ streaming service at its investor day yesterday, and investors gave the company a standing ovation, lifting the stock 11.5%. The service will cost $6.99 per month, or $69.99 for an annual plan, significantly undercutting Netflix, which recently raised prices.
The service will launch Nov. 12 with significant new, original content and offerings from Disney's extensive libraries and assets coming from the Fox acquisition. In the first year, Disney+ will feature 25 original series and 10 original films, documentaries, and specials, along with 7,500 episodes and 500 movies from the company's trove of content. It will also have 30 seasons of The Simpsons from Fox available at the launch.
Disney expects the service to be profitable by 2024, when it anticipates 60 million to 90 million subscribers will be watching its offerings of 10,000 episodes and over 720 movies.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stunned the oil market on Friday by agreeing to acquire Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) for a staggering $50 billion. The oil giant offered an enormous 38.9% premium for Anadarko, which sent shares of both companies in opposite directions. Chevron's stock was down about 5% by 12:45 p.m. EDT while Anadarko's skyrocketed 33%.
Chevron will pay $65 per share for Anadarko, including 0.3869 of its shares and $16.25 in cash, for a total of $33 billion. Add in the assumption of Anadarko's $16 billion in debt, and the deal value rises to about $50 billion. That makes it the 11th-largest deal ever in the energy and power markets.

Chevron is buying Anadarko to strengthen its position in U.S. onshore shale plays, the Gulf of Mexico, and liquified natural gas (LNG). The acquisition will make Chevron one of the largest acreage holders and producers in the Permian Basin. It will also enable the company to leverage its LNG expertise in Australia to develop Anadarko's world-class gas resource in Mozambique.
In addition to the strong strategic fit, Chevron anticipates several other benefits. It estimates that the combined company can drive out $1 billion in annual costs. Further, Chevron believes it can save $1 billion in annual capital costs through more efficient development activities in places like the Permian. The oil giant also expects to streamline its portfolio by selling between $15 billion and $20 billion of assets. The company would use that cash to repay debt and return more money to shareholders. That includes boosting its share buyback program from $4 billion to $5 billion per year.
The deal makes lots of strategic sense from Chevron's perspective. However, it wasn't the only bidder, as Occidental Petroleum reportedly offered more than $70 a share -- so it's possible there could still be a bidding war for Anadarko. If that were to happen, shares of Chevron could slide even further if it needs to pay more for its desired target.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) jolted the oil market this week by agreeing to buy rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). The oil giant is paying a whopping $50 billion for Anadarko in a combination of stock, cash, and the assumption of debt. The transaction will significantly bolster Chevron's operations in U.S. shale, the Gulf of Mexico, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). It will also boost the company's midstream portfolio given Anadarko's sizable stake in Western Midstream (NYSE:WES).
Chevron has agreed to acquire all Anadarko's outstanding shares for $33 billion, or $65 per share. That's a massive 38.9% premium to the closing price on Thursday. The company will pay 0.3869 of its shares plus $16.25 in cash (roughly $8 billion in total) for each of Anadarko's shares. Furthermore, it will assume all $16 billion of Anadarko's debt, which brings the total enterprise value of the deal to about $50 billion.

The deal does several things for Chevron. First, it enhances the company's portfolio in three key areas. It will fortify Chevron's U.S. onshore shale position in the fast-growing Permian Basin while also adding Anadarko's leading position in the DJ Basin. Chevron will also build on its capabilities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Finally, the company will be able to grow its LNG business thanks to Anadarko's discovery of a world-class gas resource offshore Mozambique.
The transaction also brings several financial benefits. Chevron expects to save $1 billion in annual operating costs by combining the two companies. Also, it anticipates saving $1 billion in capital costs per year by leveraging its greater scale in its core regions. The company expects the deal to be accretive to both its free cash flow as well as earnings per share within one year after closing. That's assuming the global oil price benchmark averages $60 a barrel, which is well below the current price.
Lastly, Chevron sees the opportunity to high-grade its portfolio by selling noncore assets. Overall, it expects to unload $15 billion to $20 billion of assets between 2020 and 2022. These sales could come from Anadarko's portfolio -- such as some of its international positions like Algeria and Ghana -- or from Chevron's vast asset base, including potentially dropping down some of its infrastructure assets to Western Midstream. The proceeds from those sales as well as the anticipation of higher cash flow will allow Chevron to return more cash to shareholders by increasing its share repurchase rate 25% to $5 billion per year.

This transaction could spark further deal-making in the oil patch, especially in the Permian Basin. Chevron will be one of the largest producers and acreage holders in that region, which will give it a competitive advantage over rivals. It will be able to leverage its control of Western Midstream to build the infrastructure needed to support its growth. In addition, its massive scale will give it an edge in securing much-needed services and equipment at competitive rates.
That could spur others in the region to make deals to strengthen their scale. Big oil rival Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A)(NYSE:RDS.B), for example, has been openly seeking to boost its position in that play. So, this deal could be the nudge it needs to make a deal. That would enable Shell to better compete with not only Chevon but Exxon, which also controls a large-scale position in the region. In addition to potential big oil buys, Permian-focused companies could join forces to increase their scale so that they aren't takeover targets themselves. Companies like Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) and Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) have been aggressive buyers in the Permian in recent years. Diamondback and Concho each spent more than $9 billion to acquire Permian-focused peers last year. Those deals have enabled them to build up large positions in the region, which also makes them attractive takeout targets for larger rivals.
Chevron's bold move to buy Anadarko not only bolsters its portfolio in several key areas but should enhance its financial results. That sets the company up to create more value for its investors in the coming years as the oil market recovers. The deal could also force rivals into making more defensive moves so that they can combat Chevron's enhanced scale in the Permian. That could make 2019 a busy year for M&A in the oil patch.
