Stocks held Thursday's gains and proceeded to tack on close to 1% this morning. Investors quickly forgot last week's pessimism and big losing streak as hopes grew that Europe would move to curb its growing debt problem. Yesterday, Mario Draghi reinforced his commitment to saving the euro, leading investors to expect some form of stimulus and sending stocks soaring. By noon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEX: ^DJI) flirted with 13,000, gaining 0.83%. The S&P 500 (INDEX: ^GSPC) was up 1.13%.
Positive domestic news also contributed to the market's rise as investors held onto their shimmery hopes of further stimulus. As expected, gross domestic product only expanded at 1.5% between April and June, the weakest increase since the third quarter of 2011. While this may seem like bad news, the announcement hit the sweet spot where it exceeded lower projections, but was still weak enough to potentially indicate more Fed assistance is on the way. The news countered the lukewarm earnings season so far, as many companies have beat earnings estimates but missed revenue projections.
Dow in Focus
Merck (NYSE: MRK) stole the show on the Dow, rallying over 3% after the pharmaceutical company beat earnings estimates. The business reported earnings of $1.05 per share, beating estimates by $0.04, largely due to higher sales of diabetes medicines Januvia and Janumet. Merck has been streamlining operations to prepare for popular asthma drug Singulair's loss of patent protection in August, and so far its plan seems to be working. The company's performance helped boost health care to the top performing sector on the S&P 500.
Chevron (NYSE: CVX) lagged the Dow, posting a slight 0.3% loss on disappointing earnings. The oil company earned $3.66 per share last quarter, less than last year's $3.85 mark, and revenue fell by 9%. Falling prices hurt the oil giant's profit, as did its struggle to produce sufficiently to keep up with demand. The bleak picture painted by Chevron's earnings likely hurt peer ExxonMobil as well, as Exxon shares also trailed the Dow.
Momentum from earlier in the week continued to buoy Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), which gained almost 2% so far today. On Wednesday, the industrial company posted strong second-quarter earnings because of rising sales volume, even as economists warned of slowing international growth. Also, a potential pickup in homebuilding improves the company's future prospects, leading Caterpillar to raise its full-year profit forecast on increased demand in North America.

It's at 13,000 and counting! That's right, the Dow Jones (INDEX: ^DJI) has high-jumped the 13,000-point mark today, returning to heights not seen since early May. The Dow is up for the third straight day on more reassurance coming from European leaders. Yesterday the markets were buoyed by guarantees from the European Central Bank to step in and ease capital liquidity if debt worries continued to rise. Today the ECB was backed by the top politicians in the eurozone, who stating their willingness to help the markets stage a rally in an attempt to drive economic growth and decrease unemployment. Equity indexes soared throughout Europe and, more importantly, sovereign debt yields decreased significantly, with Spain's 10-year yield trading almost a full percent lower than last week.
The eurozone optimism helped the broad markets in the United States climb higher despite confirmation that the U.S. economy is sputtering. The Commerce Department released second-quarter figures showing the GDP growth rate plummeted to a dismal 1.5%, down from 2% in the first quarter and 4.1% in the final quarter of 2011. On top of that, consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level of the year, with high unemployment the biggest cause for worry. Consumers are uncertain of the future, holding off on purchasing big-ticket items while increasing individual savings.

Dow component Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is up 0.86% despite reporting a 7% drop in net income during the second quarter. Like other oil players, the company was filleted by decreasing North American natural gas prices and the 20% haircut in crude prices over the last quarter. Although profits were down, Chevron beat analyst expectations, with refining margins increasing significantly, leading to an 80% increase of downstream profits. Merck (NYSE: MRK) is up 2.28% after reporting earnings per share of $1.05, $0.04 greater than expected.
Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI) has had one tough year, but today brought relief to the battered company after reporting second-quarter numbers that beat Wall Street's expectations. Arch Coal reported losses for last quarter, citing weaker-than-anticipated shipments and rising costs, but revenue grew faster than expected, leading to a 27.38% gain on the day. Another battered company on the brink of collapse is ATP Oil & Gas (Nasdaq: ATPG). The offshore exploration company is down 32% on the day after the company's bondholders organized a group to represent their interests in a possible restructuring. The company has $1.5 billion payment at just under 12% interest coming due in 2015, and with continued delays and missed output quotes, the company's solvency is far from certain.
Takeaway
Today Europe's political elite decided to back the ECB, declaring that they'll do whatever is necessary to keep the euro together. However, the debt situation still hangs in the balance. Investors need to continually search for excellent investments that will provide strong and secure returns.

After soaring at the open and rising more than 1.6% yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrials (INDEX: ^DJI) and S&P 500 (INDEX: ^GSPC) are pointing toward a more modest, but positive, open this morning. Comments yesterday that Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank were "ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro" were a boon for global markets, driving record-high Spanish bond yields sharply lower on hopes for a new bond buying program.
Facebook falters
As with Apple before it, trading in Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) shares will garner plenty of attention this morning following the company's failure to address investor concerns with its first earnings release as a public company yesterday. The company met quarterly expectations, but that wasn't enough to change the common investor perception that Facebook's growth story is nothing more than folklore. Shares tumbled about 10% in aftermarket trading as Zuckerberg & Co. failed to provide guidance and offered no tangible evidence that growth would accelerate in the near future. Instead, management offered anecdotal evidence of its opportunities as users quickly migrate toward its mobile platform.
The primary economic data to watch today will be an advance reading on second-quarter GDP. As the broadest measure of U.S. economic activity, the report will offer a glimpse into the blended impact of dampened domestic consumer spending and slowing demand from overseas. Expectations are for growth of 1.5%, a deceleration from the 1.9% growth booked in the first quarter. The report comes ahead of Federal Reserve meetings next week, where policymakers will discuss both the need and the options for additional monetary easing amid a slowing economy.
Dow component Merck (NYSE: MRK) reported results this morning, reiterating its full-year outlook and beating earnings expectations by $0.04, posting adjusted earnings per share of $1.05. Revenue at the pharmaceutical giant also beat estimates, coming in at $12.3 billion versus consensus estimates of $12.15 billion. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) also reports earnings today, with revenue and EPS expected to fall to $68.6 billion and $3.24, respectively.

With the opening ceremonies for the 2012 Olympic Games tonight, billions of people will spend the next two weeks thinking from a global perspective. That's a viewpoint that investors already know quite well, with Europe's ongoing debt crisis and threats of economic slowdowns elsewhere around the world. But for today, the stock market seems squarely focused on domestic concerns, with the first read on second-quarter U.S. GDP coming in with growth of just 1.5%. That may sound like bad news, but it has once again raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will take measures to speed up the pace of recovery, and that sent the Dow Jones Industrials (INDEX: ^DJI) up more than 100 points just after 11:00 a.m. EDT, adding to its big gains yesterday.
Merck (NYSE: MRK) was the big Dow winner this morning, rising more than 3% as the company announced second-quarter earnings that were ahead of analyst expectations. Although net income fell from year-ago levels, revenue rose 1.3%, and the pharma giant's diabetes drugs helped pick up the slack. Still, the company faces a big hit when its asthma drug Singulair loses patent protection later this year.
ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), on the other hand, dropped about a third of a percent. Rival Chevron (NYSE: CVX) announced earnings that beat expectations, with weakness in oil and natural gas prices offset by big margins from the company's refining business. With natural gas finally rebounding, though, and oil back above $90 per barrel, Exxon's prospects look like they should be better this quarter if those trends continue.
Finally, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) was up slightly. As a major sponsor of the Olympics, McDonald's hopes that extra exposure will help boost its international presence. Yet given the amount the company already spends on marketing, it's worth wondering just how much of an extra boost the fast-food behemoth gets for its sponsorship dollars. Nevertheless, viewers can expect to see a lot of McDonald's in the coming weeks.
Let the games begin!
The Olympics are a fascinating spectacle as we watch athletes from around the world give it their all. Sometimes, though, it seems like it takes an Olympian effort just to find the best investments.
