Fear of war in Syria has U.S. stocks selling off today, fueled by a rise in gold and oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down 1.09% as of 3:30 p.m. EDT, with 27 of 30 components in the red, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) has fallen 1.53%. Britain, France, Canada, the Arab League, and the U.S. urged a firm response to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons against civilians, and that could bring the U.S. closer to an air strike -- or even war. That type of uncertainty makes investors uneasy, and that's why stocks are down today.
When there's uncertainty in the Middle East and the threat of war looms large, one of the first things to rise is the price of oil. That has helped stabilize Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), which are flat today. The positive here is that oil explorers are facing higher costs to find and extract oil as traditional land sources dry up, so higher oil prices will expand margins on that side of the business.
Of course, higher oil prices are only good if you can pass those costs on to customers, and concerns about that pricing power is keeping a lid on oil stocks today. You can see below that as prices have risen over the past decade, consumption has fallen, which isn't good for Big Oil.

Consumers are turning to more efficient vehicles and alternative fuels, and that will continue if gas prices spike. For Chevron and ExxonMobil, a step forward in exploration profits may be followed by a step backward in refining and retail profits. That's why the potential of war may push oil higher, though it isn't necessarily good for Big Oil.

Yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) pump-faked the market, trading higher through most of the session before dropping significantly in the last hour and closing down 64 points. The Dow certainly isn't rebounding today, dropping 0.87% as of 2:45 p.m. EDT. The market is continuing its downward trend today as the world considers potential military action against Syria, prompting some investors to seek the safety of bonds. That volatility has left few winners in the Dow today; here are some of the movers and shakers in the Dow today.
Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is one of few Dow component trading in the black today, up 0.2%, as escalating tensions in Syria and the Middle East tend to send gas prices higher. In other news, Total SA and a Cairo-based Beltone Private Equity said they have bought some of Chevron's Egyptian business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The price tag hasn't been confirmed but the purchase includes 66 service stations, 2 oil depots and aviation fuel operations at two airports.
Chevron's small sale doesn't change the company's long-term outlook much. The company is expected to post additional growth after 2014 thanks to several new projects, such as its two liquid-natural-gas projects in Australia.
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) is trading 1% lower today following last week's worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings report. The market isn't showing the company any mercy as Hewlett-Packard has now become the 12th-most shorted stock in the Dow, according to Forbes. Even after its recent stock-price decline HP is up 55% for the year and is finding it difficult to convince investors it can complete a turnaround with ever-increasing competition -- fueling the bears and short-sellers.
Boeing (NYSE:BA
) is one of the Dow's biggest losers today, down 2.2%. The aviation juggernaut signed only 90 new contracts in July versus 287 in the prior month, which is bad news in an industry that has struggled since the recession. Investors don't have to worry much regarding short-term decline in contracts, because Boeing has a ridiculous $410 billion backlog of orders -- roughly 4.5 times its entire 2013 sales estimate. On top of that, Boeing recently improved its 20-year outlook, raising its estimated aircraft demand to 35,000 units totaling nearly $4.8 trillion. If you're looking for revenue security in the face of adversity, Boeing is a compelling investment option.
Outside the Dow, Ford (NYSE:F
) and General Motors continue to have a rough August, losing more than 3% today. Both stocks have enjoyed a solid stock-price increase since March and surged following great second-quarter earnings reports in July. While retailers have seen weaker spending, pent-up vehicle demand and low interest rates have kept seasonally adjusted annual rates strong -- see below. Next week's automotive sales release for August could give investors a reason to jump back on board.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Stocks have taken a jolting turn lower today, and as of 2:30 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down about 160 points, with only a few stocks on the blue-chip index managing to keep their heads above water. Instability's on the rise as comments from Washington have sparked fears of a U.S. intervention in Syria, adding a new blend of political turmoil into a mix that already included worries about quantitative easing. Should you be concerned for your portfolio?
Syria heats up
A U.S.-led coalition intervention in the Middle East certainly isn't something investors could prepare for. While the prospect of a wider Syrian conflict is troubling for political and economic reasons, such instability won't directly affect the majority of stocks on the markets. Expect market instability aplenty to come from the developing situation -- especially if the Department of Defense carries through on today's warning and launches a strike as soon as Thursday, as it told reporters -- but this shouldn't seriously alter your investment strategy. As with all volatile events, the smart investors will look down the road and ride out the short-term storm.
The defense sector could see a meaningful impact from a wider Syrian conflict, but the uncertainty of how the events will play out means that you shouldn't base your investing decisions on this alone. United Technologies (NYSE:RTX
) isn't benefiting today: The defense and industrial conglomerate's shares are down 2.2% to rank among the Dow's leading laggards.
UTC's best options in the defense sector are long-term plays. The company's Pratt & Whitney subsidiary has thrived on the construction of military jet engines as the Pentagon pours money into the fifth-generation F-35 project. The subsidiary accounted for more than a quarter of UTC's total revenue from military engines last year -- a $4 billion sum that could grow as the F-35 project ramps up. Costs are also falling, and while investors should be concerned about the DoD's cash-strapped budget potentially slashing some F-35 orders, UTC yesterday finalized another $1 billion for F-35 engines.
Diversity's the name of the game for a large conglomerate like UTC, so even if defense cuts impact Pratt & Whitney and helicopter-manufacturing subsidiary Sikorsky, the company won't be hurting as much as more concentrated defense-contractor rivals.
Outside the defense sector, Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) among the only Dow stocks making any headway today: The oil giant's shares are up about 0.2%. Chevron agreed to sell its retail network in Egypt to French competitor Total (NYSE:TOT
) in a deal announced by the latter today. With more than 1.4 million tons of annual sales in a network consisting of 66 service stations and other assorted infrastructure, it's a big move for Total as it looks to develop its reach outside of Europe.
For Chevron and its investors, it's a safe move. The Egyptian government announced recently that it's having a hard time paying foreign oil firms operating in the country, and the nation's civil turmoil could extend for some time. While Chevron might lose its infrastructure in the nation for the long term, it's a way for the company to scrap an uncertain business and pursue more lucrative opportunities.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Rising fears that the U.S. will intervene in the Syrian conflict has oil prices up and the U.S. markets down. As of 1:25 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) has dropped 136 points, or 0.91%, to 14,811. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is down 1.29% to 1,635.
There were two U.S. economic releases today.

Both can basically be overlooked. The Case-Shiller home price index continued to rise in June at a slightly slower pace than in May. Year over year, the index is up 12.1% -- no change there since May. The big question is what July's numbers will hold. Last Friday we found out that new-home sales dropped a seasonally adjusted 13% in July. Tomorrow we get the pending-home-sales report for July, which should show whether pending home sales also dropped sharply. Housing has led the U.S. recovery, but many believe the housing market will be challenged by the large jump in mortgage rates. We will have to wait until tomorrow to find out more.
Meanwhile, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose to 81.5, beating both July's result and analyst expectations of a drop to 78. While confidence is slowly returning, the index is well below the normal level for a growing economy.
These reports have not been enough to push the Dow upward. All but one of the Dow's 30 stocks are in the red. Fears are rising of a U.S. military intervention in Syria after reports indicated that Syrian government troops used chemical weapons in an attack against rebel forces just outside of Damascus. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied the reports in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia yesterday. President Obama had previously said that a chemical-weapons attack would be a red line that, if crossed, would lead to a U.S. intervention, specifically saying in an interview with NBC a year ago: "We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. ... That would change my equation."
The fear of U.S. military intervention and possible spillover effects in the region have the price of oil, as well as traditional safe heavens like gold and U.S. Treasuries, on the rise. Both Brent crude and WTI crude are up roughly 3%, while gold is up 1.8% to $1,418. While uncertainty is rising, what can investors do? Your time is best spent ignoring the market's ups and downs and focusing on your investing plan -- or making an investing plan, if you don't have one. If the market's drop continues, opportunities will arise for long-term investors to pick up undervalued companies.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
As it seems inevitable that the U.S. will be involved in some sort of strike against Syria, investors are taking risk off the table and the markets in general are moving lower. As of 11:45 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is currently down 84 points or 0.57%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell even harder. The S&P is down 0.89% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has lost 1.09% this morning.
The issues in Syria don't only highlight the problems Western European countries and the U.S. have with Syria, but also point out that other nations in the Middle East and Russia are opposing U.S. intervention in the Syrian conflict. As tensions rise in the Middle East, so do gas prices, and that has helped Dow components ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), which are higher by 0.28% and 0.61%, respectively, so far today. Light crude is up 2.44%, as unleaded gasoline has risen just more than 2% today. If an attack on Syria does happen, it's not hard to see these prices going even higher, which may help the oil companies but will surely put a squeeze on American wallets.
Outside the Dow, shares of J.C. Penney (OTC:JCPN.Q
) are trading higher by 2.81% today after it was announced that all of Bill Ackman's shares in the company were purchased last night by other investors. The fact that he was the largest shareholder and could sell his entire stake as quickly as he did is giving other investors confidence today and pushing the share price higher. But although now that Ackman is off the board and his huge stake in the company has been divested, J.C. Penney still has a long ways to go. The company was struggling when he came on board, and while we could argue whether it's in worse shape or not now, the fact is, it's not doing great overall.  
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS
) is losing 1.18% of its value today after a report was released indicating that the investment bank lost tens of millions of dollars because of a computer glitch that caused an overwhelming number of erroneous options trades last week. We have seen in the past how flawed trading programs can cause flash crashes, destroy investment firms, and cost investors billions. The problem is clearly not just with the small players, as this is the highest-profile firm to report a problem with computer trading.

On this day in economic and business history...
Aug. 27 is one of the most important days in the history of the energy industry for two reasons: coal and oil. Let's take a look at the historic events that took place regarding both of these critical fuels, which combine to provide 56% of all American energy. We'll delve into another energy-industry milestone as well.
Fired up
On Aug. 27, 1838, the Mauch Chunk blast furnace in Pennsylvania became the first industrial furnace to smelt iron with anthracite coal. This took place three decades after the first documented use of the harder, hotter-burning coal as a source of fuel, and it was the culmination of more than a decade of effort to put anthracite to work in iron furnaces.
The Mauch Chunk furnace turned out more than 100 tons of anthracite-fired iron before halting production in 1839, but its success was soon replicated. A year after the Mauch Chunk furnace went cold, the Lehigh Crane Iron Company began to fire iron with anthracite in its own furnace. By the end of the 1840s, there were 55 anthracite-fired blast furnaces in Pennsylvania alone, and by 1860, nearly 60% of total American iron-production came from anthracite-fired blast furnaces. Anthracite coal mining volume in the United States peaked in 1917 at an incredible 100 million tons, which means that more than 6,340 pounds of anthracite coal were extracted from beneath American soils every second of the year.
Anthracite coal production in the U.S. has declined dramatically since 1917, and today barely 2 million tons are mined each year. However, total coal production has not been hampered -- nearly 1.1 billion tons of coal was mined in the U.S. in 2010. The largest American producer that year, Peabody Energy (OTC:BTU
), dug up 146 million tons of that total.
The dawn of a new industry
The American oil industry was born on Aug. 27, 1859, when "Colonel" Edwin Drake struck oil 70 feet beneath the surface of Titusville, Penn. It was not the first time oil was extracted. In fact, naturally occurring "oil seeps" had been exploited for more than a thousand years, and accidental oil wells had been created for several decades prior to Drake's discovery by drillers who sought out subterranean salt brine. But it was the first time that a modern, purpose-built oil rig dug into the earth and found black gold. Drake's success set off an oil-drilling boom that has never stopped.
The Drake success story almost never happened. By chance, Drake happened to stay at the same hotel as the founders of the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company (later renamed Seneca Oil), the first oil company in the U.S. His desperate need for work, as well as prior connections allowing him free rail travel, helped the inexperienced Drake wedge his foot in the door as the company's first drill foreman. Drake was hired in 1858 on an annual salary of $1,000 (equal to about $29,000 today) and was sent to drill the area near Titusville where oil seeps had been found.
Drake spent much of the next few months building a derrick in the style of existing salt-brine wells. The ground beneath Drake's derrick was loose with gravel and threatened to cave in the borehole before drilling had gone 20 feet down. Urja Dav of Pennsylvania State University explains the breakthrough that allowed Drake to keep drilling and eventually succeed:
In order to overcome the hurdles before him, he invented a "drive pipe" or "conductor," an invention he unfortunately did not patent. Accordingly to The Daily Picayune, "Mr. Drake conceived the idea of driving a pipe down to the rock through which to start the drill." Drake's invention drilled an average of three feet per day through rock and shale. Although the "drive pipe" caused some problems, it paid off on August 27, 1859 when at a shallow 69.5 feet Drake struck black gold.
By this time, Seneca Oil had abandoned Drake and his pursuits, refusing to help him out financially, causing him to use his own money and when that had run out, to borrow from friends. It is estimated that his well produced between 20-40 barrels daily, using all the whiskey barrels in Titusville. In fact, Western Pennsylvania produced half of the world's oil until the East Texas oil boom in 1901.
Unfortunately, Drake's failure to patent his drive pipe was only one of his devastating business missteps. Drake's former business partners took four years to pay him back for the successful discovery, and by this point he had lost his savings in the oil price crash of the early 1860s. From 1859 to 1961, the price of a barrel of oil had plunged from $20 to $0.52 (a 98% decline!) as many hungry prospectors moved in and freely made use of Drake's innovation.
Only 2,000 barrels of oil were produced in the U.S. in 1859. Annual production grew more than thousand-fold by the end of 1861 -- a year that saw American drillers extract over 2.1 million barrels of oil, mostly from Pennsylvania. This incredible year-over-year growth would not happen again in American history, although annual domestic production continued to grow well into the 20th century.
Oil production has since become one of the most important facets of the American economy. This has been reflected in Big Oil's numerous placements on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
): Since 1915, oil companies have served for a cumulative 239 years as index components. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) have represented Big Oil on the Dow since 1928 and 1930, respectively (though Chevron was booted from 1999 to 2008, which proved a big mistake for the Dow).
The combined revenue of the five largest oil companies operating in U.S. markets -- ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and ConocoPhillips -- was equivalent to more than 10% of American GDP in 2011. Domestic oil and gas claims to have contributed $476 billion to the U.S. economy in 2010, in the form of royalties, capital investments, wages, and dividend payments -- an "energy stimulus," according to the Energy Tomorrow project of the American Petroleum Institute.
(Backup) power to the people
The world's largest battery system was switched on in Fairbanks, Alaska on Aug. 27, 2003. The $35 million, 1,400-ton, nickel-cadmium monstrosity was built to prevent the cascading blackouts that plagued Fairbanks every other year and to forestall the constant threat of lesser blackouts in the icy town, which had no connection to an electrical grid. Built by a division of energy products specialist ABB (NYSE:ABB
), the battery system is capable of generating 40 megawatts of power for up to seven minutes -- enough to keep 12,000 homes powered while the city's backup diesel generators are pushed into service.
The lessons learned in building Fairbanks' battery may help future projects far exceed its scale. A Chinese battery array, completed in 2012, can power a similar number of homes for up to an hour and is estimated to have cost half a billion dollars to construct. In 2013, Japan began building a monster battery system with nearly twice the capacity of China's, with the capacity to store 60 megawatt-hours produced by nearby solar arrays.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Proponents of the efficient-market theory believe the stock market incorporates all available information. Yet today's market move is a good argument against that theory. Troubles in Syria have been around for years, yet only now are investors starting to give the conflict much credibility. With geopolitical risk once again emerging as an ever-present threat after having been ignored by investors for months, stock markets have fallen sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) down 110 points as of 10:55 a.m. EDT.
But there are pockets of strength in the Dow, as some industries appear to be benefiting from the return of risk. Both ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) have posted modest advances for the day as both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude futures rise between $2.50 and $3 per barrel today. So far, triple-digit oil prices haven't really played a major role in slowing economic growth, and both Exxon and Chevron could benefit from wider spreads between Brent and domestic crude. Although that spread is less than $5 right now, it's wider than the roughly $2 to $3 we've seen recently, and greater domestic production could once again push those spreads still higher.
Still, you'll find the real strength in commodities outside the Dow. Gold has continued its recent climb to $1,420 per ounce. After largely losing their role as safe-haven investments, precious metals have bounced sharply off their recent lows as investors focus less on the Fed's imminent monetary-policy moves to focus instead on protecting against the possibility of heightened international conflict. Those concerns have pushed SPDR Gold (NYSEMKT:GLD
) up 1.2% today to its highest levels since May, and several major gold-mining companies have enjoyed larger gains as investors once again flock to bet on the potential for a renewal of the long bull market in gold.
