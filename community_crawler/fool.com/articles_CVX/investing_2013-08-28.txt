After a two-day slide on Syria developments, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) bounced back today, seemingly on the same news as energy stocks rose with oil prices. Crude futures hit two-year highs earlier, hovering around $110 a barrel on concerns of a U.S.-led strike, although Syria is not itself a major oil producer. Its oil production has declined from 350,000 barrels a day in March to just 50,000, and the country has been banned from exporting crude since sanctions went into effect in 2011. However, prices have risen on concerns that the simmering conflict could destabilize the region, as it's serving as a proxy battle between Saudi Sunnis and Iranian Shiites. The jump in energy prices sent shares of the Dow's two oil majors, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), up 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. After both companies posted disappointing quarters in their latest reports, rising energy prices should help them overcome structural weaknesses and declining production in the short term.
Elsewhere, the housing market got more negative news as pending home sales fell 1.3% in July, while economists had predicted a gain of 0.2%. As mortgage rates have risen with expectations of the Federal Reserve's stimulus taper, the housing recovery has cooled off this summer. In a separate report, mortgage applications also fell 2.4% last week, its third straight weekly decline.
Elsewhere on the Dow, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG
) was the worst performer, falling 1.4%. There was no company-specific news out on P&G today, but the market may still be reacting to news reported this weekend that reinstated CEO A.G Lafley will not move to headquarters in Cincinnati, indicating that his return to the helm may be shorter than expected. Lafley replaced Bob McDonald, who retired after leading the company for four years of what many considered underwhelming returns. The consumer-goods giant seems to have hit a plateau as it struggles with finding ways to grow sales in its mature markets, which make up the bulk of its profits.

Dividend investors would be wise to focus not just on a stock's current yield, but also on the long-term growth potential of its dividends. That's because strong businesses that consistently raise their dividend payouts reward shareholders with a steadily rising income stream that essentially equates to a raise every year. And, well, who doesn't like a raise?
But there are other reasons to value dividend growth so highly, and they're well supported by research. For instance, a study by C. Thomas Howard  published in Advisor Perspectives found that for every percentage point a stock's yield rises, its annual return increases by 0.22 percentage points if it's a large cap, 0.25 if it's a mid cap, and 0.46 if it's a small cap. Even better, Howard found that dividend-growing stocks outperformed dividend cutters by 10 percentage points per year from 1973 to 2010 and beat both flat- and no-dividend stocks. And the icing on the cake is that Howard showed that this outperformance came with a third less volatility. Higher returns, less volatility-induced stress, and a steadily growing income stream -- what's not to love?
With that in mind, here are five stocks that have grown their dividends significantly above the rate of inflation in the past year.
Company
1-Year Dividend Growth Rate
Chevron (NYSE:CVX
)
12.1%
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO
)
9.2%
UPS (NYSE:UPS
)
9.2%
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP)
8.8%
Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB
)
7.6%
SOURCE: S&P CAPITAL IQ.
As a major integrated energy company, Chevron is involved in many aspects of the energy production spectrum, from the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, to the refining of crude oil and the manufacture of petrochemicals, to coal mining operations and alternative fuel sources. This energy titan currently sports a top-tier five-star rating in CAPS and is yielding 3.4%.
As the world's leading soft-drink company, Coca-Cola needs little introduction. Coca-Cola has built a beverage empire on the globally popular Coke and Diet Coke brands, but its offerings also include noncarbonated drinks such as Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, and Dasani bottled water. This Fool favorite has a four-star CAPS rating and offers investors a 2.9% dividend.
UPS's massive global network allows it to deliver packages to 220 countries and territories. Its tremendous scale and logistical expertise have helped UPS build a wide moat around its business, and the company's ample free cash flow generation has allowed it to return cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and rising dividends (currently 2.9%). CAPS participants no doubt appreciate this and have given UPS a four-star rating.
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' valuable network of pipelines transports a host of products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, natural gas, and natural gas liquids to various markets in North America. These pipelines act as tollbooths -- earning a fee every time products pass through Kinder Morgan's network. And as a master limited partnership, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners passes on that cash flow to its unit holders in the form of a hefty 6.4% dividend, which has also helped KMP earn a five-star rating on CAPS.
With brands including Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, and Pull-Ups, Kimberly-Clark's paper and personal-care products hold the No. 1 or No. 2 brand share in more than 80 countries. In fact, nearly one-quarter of the world's population purchases Kimberly-Clark's products every day. Its top-selling brands have earned the trust of billions of consumers, and its solid 3.5% yield has led income-seeking investors to award Kimberly-Clark with a four-star CAPS rating.
The Foolish bottom line
Had you invested in these companies a year ago, you would have enjoyed total dividend increases ranging from 7% to 12%. And, importantly, all of these companies grew their payout much faster than the rate of U.S. inflation during that time, thereby protecting (and growing) your purchasing power. But more important to investors today is to identify the companies that will grow their dividends substantially in the years ahead. If you're interested in hearing about some excellent companies that are likely to boost their dividends from this point forward, I'd like to offer you a brand-new free report from The Motley Fool's expert analysts called "Secure Your Future With 9 Rock-Solid Dividend Stocks."

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
After two consecutive losing sessions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) recovered a portion of those losses on Wednesday. While the Syrian conflict remains the central point of discussion throughout the international community, energy stocks fueled the Dow's gains as the price of oil continued to creep higher. The Dow, by day's end, added 48 points, or 0.3%, ending at 14,824.
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) surged 2.8%, less than a week after management's quarterly earnings call sent the stock plunging 12.5% in a single day. Last Thursday's sudden drop was brought on by a bleak outlook that emphasized HP's lack of success in the enterprise division. But today's news that Cerner (NASDAQ: CERN) will be using HP's analytical platform showed investors that the company is having at least some success shifting its focus away from the struggling PC market. 
With the oil and gas sector advancing nearly four times as much as any other area in the markets today, it's no surprise Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) stock jumped 2.5% on Wednesday. It's lucky for the Dow, too: Chevron is the second most influential component of the price-weighted Dow's average, holding about 15 times the sway that Alcoa's (NYSE: AA) stock does.
On the losing side of things, Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ
) lost 0.8%. Shares were unable to repeat yesterday's gravity-defying performance, when Verizon was one of only two Dow stocks to gain ground. Not only was the telecom sector -- unlike energy stocks -- out of favor Wednesday, but bond yields ticked higher, luring some income investors away from dividend stocks like Verizon. From a long-term perspective, today's decline isn't much to worry about. Potential investors should instead pay close attention to any moves by Verizon to enter the Canadian market, which could mean good things for the company's growth prospects. 
Finally, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG
) shed 1.4%, falling victim to some of the same woes that Verizon's stock did today: a healthy dividend yield and a sector Wall Street wasn't a fan of. At the end of the day, P&G will likely be the same sort of low-risk, low-growth investment it has been for years on end. Sales volume rose 2% in the last year, while prices ticked up a modest 1%. Revenue isn't exactly shooting to the moon, but it's growth nonetheless.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
U.S. stocks have shrugged off yesterday's losses and pushed higher today despite the rising price of oil. WTI Crude oil rose 0.8% today to $110 per barrel and even touched $112 for a moment, driven by speculation that the U.S. and its allies will get involved in the Syrian conflict. But higher oil prices aren't having the same negative effect on markets today that they had yesterday: Near the end of the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is up 0.61%, and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) has risen 0.59%.
The only other significant economic news was a National Association of Realtors report that pending home sales fell 1.3% in July. This wasn't shocking, given the rise in interest rates since May, but there's a huge lag in housing data, and this is still one of the early signs that show the market slowing.  
Trading on the Dow is generally mixed, but energy stocks are trading sharply higher today. Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is up 2.8%, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) is up 2.3%, driven by fear (or hope, depending on how you look at it) that oil prices will rise because of the Syrian conflict. But let's put this into perspective.
Syria isn't a huge player in the oil trade, and the U.S. has already cut off oil trading with Syria. The EU put an embargo in place as well, but this spring it began buying oil from rebel-held regions. Disruption in this trade would have little impact on either developed economy. 
The danger is that Syrian allies like Iran and Russia rush to the country's aid, escalating the conflict into more than a Syrian battle. If that happens, there are a lot of fathomable consequences that could disrupt oil flow to the U.S., Europe, and other parts of the world. But we're a long way from that outcome.
For oil companies, the story is even more complex. Higher oil prices mean higher profits for exploration and production businesses, but it also means higher costs for refining and retail. Chevron and ExxonMobil have exposure up and down the market, so unless they can pass their costs along in the form of higher gas prices, the rising price of oil could actually pinch profits. So far, that doesn't appear to be happening, because gasoline is only about $0.02 more expensive today than it was a week ago.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
America is on the brink of another war. In the words of Motown songwriting legend Barrett Strong, war is nothing but a heartbreaker and friend only to the undertaker. But this time, oil companies love the boiling tension in Syria, and energy investors are already reaping the rewards.
The Syrian crisis is a direct threat to one of the world's richest sources of crude oil. That's why oil prices are skyrocketing right now, with various grades of crude oil jumping about 3% overnight. Shares of oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) have responded with a 1.9% price surge as of 1:30 p.m. EDT, and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) scored an even larger 2.6% gain. Combined, the two oil stocks account for most of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES:^DJI
) 67-point gain this afternoon.
Remember that this is just the rattling of sabers at dawn. If U.S. forces attack Syria via air raids or cruise missiles, as military leaders say they might do later this week, oil prices could spike much higher. This could be a very opportune time to buy Chevron and Exxon shares, albeit on very cynical grounds.
Though environmental activists might disagree, investors typically don't have to grapple with moral quandaries before buying Exxon shares. The business was built on a nonrenewable resource and all, but it's not exactly evil to exploit modern society's thirst for the black gold.
But at this particular moment, oil stocks are a kind of "sin stock." If oil prices skyrocket 40% in a week, as some experts say they might if we go to war in Syria, isn't that akin to price-gouging consumers at the gas station when a hurricane is rolling into town?
Then again, nobody expects Chevron to shut down its international operations over this political conflict. That would just drive prices even higher as American suppliers drop out of the global oil trade. In the end, the oil giants are just playing the hand they're dealt and charging prices set by a free market.
Moreover, investors are taking a risk by betting on a Syrian oil-price bonanza. If our forces back down instead of shipping out, or if U.N. investigators can prove that the Syrian government wasn't responsible for last week's Sarin nerve gas attacks, then oil prices will slide back down -- and take oil stocks along for the ride. Share prices are inflated now, and there's no guarantee that they will soar even higher. This is a reversible catalyst.
Do you plan to capitalize on the Syrian controversy's potential for boosting oil prices, or would you lose sleep over the moral implications? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
Foolish disclosure policies prevent me from taking any action, now that I'm writing about it. If that weren't the case, I think I could sleep at night with some fresh Exxon or Chevron shares under my pillow. Hate the game, not the player. And don't forget that you hope to be rewarded for taking a market risk.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Oil stocks are up along with the price of oil as it seems increasingly likely that the U.S. will intervene in the Syrian conflict with cruise missiles. Oil prices are up 1%, with Brent crude at $115.66 and WTI crude at a two-year high of $110.20. Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) are both up more than 2%, leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) higher. As of 1:15 p.m. EDT the Dow is up 75 points to 14,852. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is up nine points, or 0.56%, to 1,640.

BRENT CRUDE OIL SPOT PRICE DATA BY YCHARTS.
The price of oil is spiking as the administration leaks to the media its plans for attacking Syria. It's unclear whether or not the U.S. and the U.K. will go before the UN Security Council before striking Syria. Observers expect any resolution condemning Syria to be vetoed by Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has a naval base in Tartous. It should be noted that reports out of Moscow in the past few hours indicate that Russia may be evacuating its remaining naval personnel today -- another sign that the U.S. is taking action.
In the oil economy, Syria is not a real factor: The country was a small net exporter before the crisis and is now a net importer. The price of oil is up on the fear that the surrounding region could be disrupted. Bigger players in the region have been contributing resources on both sides of the conflict, with Iran supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Saudi Arabia supporting the Syrian rebels. The big fear is that the chaos in Syria will spread into Iraq, which is facing its own problems relating to ethnic divisions. The prime minister of Iraq and his Shiite government support the Syrian government, while the Sunni opposition party supports the Syrian rebels. While it's unlikely, there are also fears that Iran will protest by closing the Straight of Hormuz, through which 20% of oil flows. There's also a small chance of all-out war breaking out between the Saudis and Iran, which would be disastrous for both countries and their oil supplies.
In any event, oil stocks are up as the price of oil remains high and could easily go higher. It should be noted that U.S. oil supplies would be stable in any event. The EIA reported this morning that U.S. commercial crude-oil inventories were up 3 million barrels from last week to 362 million barrels -- more than enough to make up for any import disruptions.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Though it wobbled slightly this morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is on its way up following the worst day for stocks since June. With Syrian troubles inciting calls for action from both the U.S. government and its allies, investors and citizens alike are concerned about the implications of military action. Closer to home, one of the stalwart factors in the country's economic recovery is starting to falter. As of 11:45 a.m. EDT, the Dow is up 50 points, though it may be short-lived.
Why so Syria-s? 
With accusations flying about the use of chemical weapons against its own civilians by President Bashar al-Assad's government, there has been sudden movement from numerous allied countries toward action in Syria. Though no word has come about the U.S.' involvement in a planned military strike, or what the goal of such a strike would be, the situation is certainly escalating quickly, causing concern on both Wall Street and Main.
As with most conflicts in the Middle East, the Syrian issue and consequent concerns have driven oil prices to their highest levels in two years. Not unexpectedly, both Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) are up more than 2% this morning on the prospect of higher gas prices. Both companies have reached new records for capital expenditures in recent months, potentially cutting into shareholder value. Though Syria is not a major producer of oil, any prolonged military action in the region could disrupt the oil supply, sending both crude oil and gas prices soaring. Investors should weigh the risks of potential oil bottlenecks in the region with the benefits of higher prices arising from the conflict.
On the homefront 
This morning's news for the housing market was less than great for investors. Rising mortgage rates have finally proven to be hitting the market with force, as both new-loan application activity and pending home sales fell for their respective periods. Last week's applications activity dropped 2.5% due to higher rates dissuading homeowners from refinancing. The activity for new-purchase loans, however, rose by 2.4%, largely supported by historically low interest rates. Though rates rose 12 basis points last week, to their highest level so far in 2013, the 4.80% rate is still remarkably low by historical standards.
Pending home sales for existing homes fell for the second straight month in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. New contracts fell by 1.3% last month, suggesting that rising interest rates have put pressure on the housing market. The latest report on sales of newly constructed homes also painted a bleaker picture for the recovering housing market, as sales of new homes fell to their lowest point in nine months in July.
Despite declines in home sales, there are a few businesses that stand to conitnue benefiting from homeowners' increased confidence in the housing market -- namely, Home Depot (NYSE:HD
) and its chief rival, Lowe's (NYSE:LOW
). The recovery in housing has also been spurred on by dramatic rises in home prices over the past 12-month period.
Consumers who believe that they can increase their home's value often spend more on upgrades. With that in mind, both home improvement stores have been somewhat immune to the recent spate of declining consumer spending that most retailers have been reporting.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
After a big down day for the stock market, it's natural for stocks to regain at least a small portion of their losses on the following day. So far, that's what we've seen in today's trading session, with broader markets posting gains of about a quarter-percent. However, adding to concerns about Syria and other geopolitical hot-spots around the world, news that pending home sales fell 1.3% once again raised the specter of a reversal in the housing market's recovery, which has been one of the linchpins of the overall U.S. economy's strength recently. Although the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) were up about 40 points as of 10:45 a.m. EDT, further bad news on any of several fronts could easily make those gains disappear quickly.
Gains in the oil sector highlight the impact that the threat of Middle East conflict is having on energy markets. With crude prices rising to two-year highs, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising 2.4%. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) is also near the top of the list with a 1.9% gain. At least for now, triple-digit oil prices have helped both Chevron and Exxon finance record levels of capital expenditures, even on higher-cost projects like ultra-deepwater sites and unconventional land-based production from oil sands and shale plays. But with worldwide presence, both companies are vulnerable to closures of choke points from a rise in armed conflict, and shareholders need to consider that risk even as they expect higher profits from rising prices.
On the other side of the coin, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
) has fallen almost 1% to lead the Dow's decliners. The stock fell in sympathy with mining-equipment rival Joy Global (NYSE:JOY
), which said in its quarterly report that it expects weaker revenue in its 2014 fiscal year, sending its shares down almost 5%. Citing a lack of commodity demand from its customers, Joy beat earnings expectations but said that current revenue levels appear unsustainable based on current conditions. Caterpillar isn't quite as focused on mining equipment as Joy Global is, but with similarly sluggish conditions in its construction-equipment business, Caterpillar has also projected long-term weakness, barring an unexpectedly quick macroeconomic recovery.
