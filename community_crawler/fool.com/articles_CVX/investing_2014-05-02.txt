The market is on the way to closing out the week in the red despite strong numbers in the government's Apriil jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
)was down 52 points as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, with most blue-chip stocks in the red and the other major stock indices falling. Big Pharma has been the big loser so far, with Merck (NYSE:MRK
) trailing all Dow stocks in losing more than 2.4%. Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) has shed around 0.2% after a disastrous earnings report. Let's catch up on what you need to know.
Jobs up, stocks down
The United States in April gained 288,000 jobs, according to the Department of Labor's release, with professional and business services jobs leading the way with a gain of about 75,000. That total was enough to knock the unemployment rate down a full 0.4 percentage points, the largest one-month decline in 31 years, to 6.3%. Still, one caveat: The labor force itself contracted by more than 800,000 people in April, helping to buoy that unemployment rate decline. While it's vital that more Americans searching for work find positions in order to sustain the recovery, propping up the labor force participation rate will be a big challenge given its freefall over the past few years. The overall labor participation rate now has met a 35 year-low, according to MarketWatch.
Merck's active week has kept up, as the stock tumbled following the recent report that the company is looking to sell off mature drug assets. The portfolio of older and mature drugs could earn the company up to $15 billion, according to sources cited by Reuters. Top Big Pharma drugmakers have looked to focus on higher-growth pharmaceuticals while spinning off or selling drugs holding back financial performance. That's especially needed at Merck, which still is struggling to jump-start sales despite a recent upbeat quarter for the company's leading duo of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet. The two drugs  collected more than $6 billion in sales last year and reported 3% revenue growth combined in the last quarter. Merck will need more of that in coming quarters while it tries to advance its highest-potential pipeline candidates to the market. A sale of older drugs that are holding back growth could be a quick way to inject much-needed cash while slashing costs and boosting profit.
However, Merck's real hit on the day came when developmental ovarian cancer drug vintafolide, which it co-developed alongside Endocyte (NASDAQ: ECYT), slammed into a brick wall of disappointing results in a phase 3 study. Endocyte's stock has fallen more than 60% so far on the day after the two companies halted the trial. Vintafolide failed to show significant efficacy in ovarian cancer patients, but it's not the end of the world for investors of either company. Vintafolide's most important trial for lung cancer goes on and is projected to release data later this year. While the failure to find success in ovarian cancer will hurt the drug's potential, peak sales estimates still stood at up to $900 million worldwide before the trial stoppage -- and there's still plenty of money at stake here for both companies.

Around the Dow, Chevron's stock hasn't fallen as far as its earnings report might indicate. The Big Oil company saw revenue tumble by more than 6% year over year, while quarterly earnings per share plunged to $2.36 -- down from last year's $3.18 mark and missing analyst expectations badly. Production falls have hit oil companies hard this earnings season; Chevron was no exception, with gas production down 3% and oil down 4% despite the ongoing American energy boom. That same boom has negatively affected prices, a trend that looks to keep on holding back Big Oil powerhouses int the near future.

On Friday morning, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) climbed at the opening bell to set themselves up for another potential record run. But by 11 a.m. EDT, the index had given up that gain and was down 26 points. Most economists focused on a strong jobs report, which showed the U.S. economy produced a 288,000-job rise in nonfarm payrolls in April and the unemployment rate fell to 6.3%, its lowest rate in nearly six years. Among the Dow's energy giants, even though it was Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) turn to report quarterly earnings this morning, rival ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) proved to be a much bigger winner in today's trading.
Chevron posted minimal gains in early trading Friday, despite reporting financials that provided further disappointment to investors who were already bracing for poor results. In the Chevron first-quarter earnings report, the oil giant noted drops both in production volume and in crude-oil prices, pushing net income down 27% on a 6% drop in revenue. Like ExxonMobil, Chevron benefited somewhat from the recovery in U.S. natural-gas prices that rose by more than half from year-ago levels. Chevron's downstream segment actually boosted earnings by just over 1%, with its domestic downstream business tripling net income from the year-ago quarter.
But ExxonMobil jumped 1% today after announcing its own results yesterday morning. Investors remain pleased that the oil giant is continuing to count on being able to drill in the Arctic Ocean off the northern coast of Russia, despite the rising threat of new U.S. economic sanctions against Moscow that could jeopardize Exxon's investment in the region. Given the amount of potential production at stake, Exxon desperately needs success in Russia in order to keep its own overall production levels up. Yet ExxonMobil has arguably benefited more from the resurgence in natural-gas prices, especially if its ill-timed acquisition of XTO Energy four years ago finally starts to look more lucrative.
In general, ExxonMobil and Chevron have taken turns rising and falling in investors' eyes, with Chevron's somewhat smaller size giving it a bit more flexibility to pursue opportunities more quickly than its larger rival. Nevertheless, in the long run, conditions in the energy industry will likely keep both ExxonMobil and Chevron moving in the same direction, and both companies are working hard to ensure that the direction they'll go remains upward.

Oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) announced first-quarter earnings before the market opened this morning, reporting earnings of $4.5 billion, or $2.36 per share. That missed analysts' estimate by $0.11 per share. It was also well below the $6.2 billion, or $3.18 per share, the company earned in last year's first quarter.
The company's results took hits from lower prices and volumes for crude oil. Prices were affected by global economic factors, while production volumes were impacted by "weather-related, unplanned downtime," notably at the company's operations in Kazakhstan, according to a Chevron press release. Overall, Chevron's production averaged 2.59 million barrels per day in the quarter, down from the 2.65 million barrels per day the company averaged in the first quarter of 2013. While the company increased production in Nigeria, Angola, and the U.S., that wasn't enough to offset the normal field declines across its portfolio, nor the issues in Kazakhstan.
Chevron continues to move forward with a number of major projects that should yield production growth starting in 2015. The company's Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in Australia, along with Jack/St. Malo and Big Foot in the Gulf of Mexico, are expected to come online over the next year. These projects are expected to play a major role in fueling a 20% production increase for Chevron by 2017, which should drive growing shareholder distributions.
