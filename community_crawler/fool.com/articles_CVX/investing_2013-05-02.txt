After gaining more than 130 points, or 0.89%, today the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) now sits at 14,831, just 1.13% below the 15,000 mark. The S&P 500 rose nearly 15 points, or 0.94%, this afternoon, and is now also just 0.18% below the 1,600 mark. With good news tomorrow on the jobs front, the S&P 500 should easily hit that target, and while the Dow could gain the 169 points in one day, it will likely be a mark which is hit sometime next week if it appears the economy is continuing to recover.
Economists are expecting the Labor Department to report that 145,000 jobs were created in April, but unemployment remained at 7.6%. For now, we will have to wait and see what happens, but the lower than expected jobless claims last week is a good sign that the report tomorrow may come in better than some anticipate.
Now, let's take a look at which Dow components were big winners today.
We often see the shares of the big oil companies rise and fall alongside of the price of oil, and today was no different. The price of oil moved higher by 3.25% after positive jobless claims data was released this morning, as well as the announcement that the ECB would lower short-term interest rates, and the expectation that we will receive a positive jobs report tomorrow. And with all that news, both of the Dow's big oil companies climbed higher today: Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) increased by 1.47%, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) rose by 1.28%. 
Shares of American Express (NYSE:AXP
) rose by 1.61% during today's trading session after its competitor Visa announced positive earnings, and a number of good signs for the industry yesterday after the market closed. Visa, which operates debit and credit cards, reported that, combined, the number of transactions increased by 4.2% in the quarter. This is great news for the industry, and shows that consumers are returning to old habits of using cards opposed to cash. More importantly, credit transactions increased by 9%, while use of debit cards were flat during the period. The transaction count increase helps profits due to transaction fees and, because credit was used more than debit, this boosts the likelihood that interest will be earned, which also pumps up profits. 
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT
) shareholders saw the value of their holding rise 1.34% today. The stock rose $0.44 per share, and hit a new 52-week high, at $33.17, on slightly lower-than-usual volume of 46 million shares trading hands. (The average is just slightly more than 50 .6 million.) After nearly 10 years of a stagnant share price only occasionally breaking the $30 barrier, the stock looks to be gaining momentum. Year to date, Microsoft is up more than 24%, making it the third best performing Dow component of 2013, behind Disney, which is up more than 28%, and Hewlett-Packard which has climbed more than 43.5%.

After yesterday's sluggish showing in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) lost 138 points on concerns over global manufacturing and slow hiring, blue chips rebounded Thursday, nearly erasing all of Wednesday's losses. Today's surge stemmed partially from a move that many economists already expected: the European Central Bank cut the benchmark refinancing rate from 0.75% to 0.5%, attempting to encourage borrowing to stimulate growth. 
What economists didn't see coming was a sudden drop in claims for jobless benefits, which reached the lowest level in more than five years. Stocks responded by firing on all cylinders, as 90% of Dow components climbed. And none rose more rapidly than Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO
), which added 1.8% after a serious stumble yesterday caused by concerns over rival Arista Networks' new super-fast data switch offering. 
While technically the third largest gainer of the day, Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) considerable weight in the index makes the oil giant's 1.5% gains worthy of discussion. Chevron shares enjoyed a boost today after an Ontario judge blocked legal efforts by a law firm to seize some of Chevron's foreign assets -- an attempt based on an $18 billion ruling against the company in Ecuador. 
Only two Dow components ended in the red, one of which was UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH
). Slipping 0.4%, investors in UnitedHealth are dealing with the fact that the dynamics of the health-care industry are changing as "Obamacare" measures go into effect. The financial impact on companies like UnitedHealth is by no means clear, which makes for anxious shareholders. 
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO
) ended as the biggest loser in the Dow Thursday, despite only slumping 0.6%. Though there wasn't one obvious catalyst causing investors to sell off today, uproar over the name of the Rio de Janeiro stadium -- where the 2016 Olympics will be held -- could be drawing unwanted press to the soda giant. The disgraced former president of FIFA, Joao Havelange, took bribes during his time in power; Rio's stadium now bears his name. Though Coke had nothing to do with Havelange's impropriety, Coke began sponsoring FIFA during Havelange's tenure.

We continue to get nuggets of positive information out of the jobs market, and investors are becoming more hopeful that tomorrow's jobs report will help drive stocks for the next month. Today, we found out that new jobless claims fell to 324,000, the lowest level we've seen in five years. Companies are clearly laying off fewer workers this year. The only problem is that they don't seem eager to hire new workers. Investors took the latest report as good news ahead of tomorrow's numbers, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) has shot 0.88% higher near the end of trading, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is up 0.96%. 
Tomorrow morning the Department of Labor will tell us how many jobs were added in April. Analysts are expecting 145,000 additional jobs and a flat unemployment rate of 7.6%.
The unemployment news, along with an announcement that the ECB will lower interest rates to 0.5%, has pushed oil 3.1% higher today. In turn, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is up 1.6% today, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) is 1.1% higher on hope that demand will increase. Demand for oil in mature markets like the U.S. and Europe has actually fallen over the past few years as the ongoing European recession hurt demand and more efficient vehicles hit the road. If lower interest rates can help Europe return to growth, it could have a big impact on the global demand for oil, which would be good for oil prices and, of course, producers like Chevron and ExxonMobil.
Boeing (NYSE:BA
) has ascended 1.1% after company's board of directors reportedly approved an update to the 777 aircraft. Airbus recently announced a $6 billion order for the competing A350-1000 for $6 billion, and Boeing will respond by redesigning the 777. The new jet wouldn't be ready until about 2020, but Boeing could begin taking orders soon. Now that the 787 is back in the air, engineers can focus on the next task, and management has chosen the 777.

Forget yesterday's losses: The markets are roaring back into the green this Thursday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is making investors everywhere smile. As of 2:15 p.m. EDT, the Dow has pulled in gains of 116 points, or 0.79%, once again closing in on a record high. Surprisingly good economic data and a welcome decision from Europe have fueled investor confidence today, and nearly every stock on the Dow is in the green. Let's catch up on the stories you need to know.
Good news on both sides of the Atlantic
The European Central Bank kicked things off this morning by cutting interest rates in an attempt to light a fire under the continent's lagging business activity. The cut brings rates to a new record low, and as inflation dips, Europe risks stagnating in its recessionary climate. ECB President Mario Draghi will likely need to do more in order to prop up the European economy as Italy and Spain, among other nations, still face mountains of debt and high unemployment.
The economy's a bit better off in the U.S., and positive data today warmed investors up to the market's rally. Jobless claims fell by 18,000 last week, setting a new weekly low not seen since early 2008. Economists expect Friday's unemployment data for April to remain at 7.6%, but the jobless dip is a good sign that the slow American recovery isn't stalling out.
Among blue-chip stocks, oil majors have surged higher. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) shares have jumped 1.2% to rank among the top Dow leaders, and fellow firm Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) has seen its stock rise 1.6%. Chevron got a boost today when a Canadian court turned away a $19 billion Ecuadorian claim against the company that stems from alleged pollution in the 1970s and '80s. While that's one less headache for Chevron, Exxon has run into trouble despite its stock's surge: The company's dealing with a small oil leak in Missouri from the same pipeline that leaked in Arkansas in March. While the spill is minuscule, it's another PR hit for a company that could use some good news.
Shares of hard-hit Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
) have also risen sharply today, pulling in gains of 1.6%. Little news is out from the company, and today's rally is likely due to investors looking to pick up a beaten-down blue-chip stock for cheap after the shares had fallen more than 11% year to date. Caterpillar is still atop its industry, making it an attractive turnaround option for the long term when leading economies and industrial spending pick up. However, investors will have to be patient: With China's rise still stuck in a slump and Europe mired in recession, this economically reliant stock isn't likely to surge anytime soon.
Finally, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM
) are also among the Dow's leaders, gaining 1.3% so far. The conglomerate posted earnings that missed analyst expectations of both EPS and revenue, and the whiff slowed down the company's stock last month after a rapid rise to start the year. Still, 3M's diversity and breadth make it a safe pick even after the company cited lower demand in some markets for the past quarter.
