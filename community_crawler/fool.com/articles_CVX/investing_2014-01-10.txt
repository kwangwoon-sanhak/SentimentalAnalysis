The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) continues its trek lower this week. The Dow has shed 40 points as of 2:15 p.m. EST, with its biggest movers diving into the red after jobs data disappointed investors with a fresh round of economic concern. Among top blue-chip stocks, Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) taking a big hit after announcing a worrying trend for its fourth-quarter production, while Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE
) among the Dow's leading laggards in the health care sector. Let's catch up on what you need to know.
One very bad jobs report
The jobs reported blindsided investors today with severely unexpected bad news, as payrolls added just 74,000 new jobs in December. That wasn't just the worst monthly mark for 2013: It marked the slowest increase in jobs for one month since January 2011, adding new speculation that the economy's rise is still sorting out bumps in the road. Economists had expected that more than 190,000 jobs would be added to the economy in December.
As a lone bright spot, the U.S. unemployment rate did fall to 6.7%, the first time it had declined below 7% in five years. That's not due to job gains, however -- it's because nearly 350,000 Americans gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force in December. While the economy did add a total of 2.2 million jobs in 2013 -- roughly what 2012 produced, a strong number -- the U.S. economy's growth needs a lot higher job growth than December's meek number.
Chevron's not inspiring much confidence in investors today, either, as the Big Oil stock is down 2% to lead all Dow laggards. The company announced today that its fourth-quarter net profit will stand roughly on par with the third-quarter profit mark of $5 billion after Chevron's gas and oil production fell. The company's 2.56 million barrels of crude oil produced during October and November is a 3.9% year-over-year drop, following weakening demand that has hit production across several of the company's competitors as well.
Falling demand has affected Chevron's finances in a bad way lately, as the company's revenue fell by 4.7% and its earnings per share also declined over the first nine months of 2013. While analysts are optimistic about a return to production growth in 2014, investors have to hope oil prices make a comeback for the majors in the new year.
Pfizer stock is down around 1% after Cowen downgraded the Big Pharma from outperform to market perform. While Pfizer has had a strong 15.5% run-up over the past year, there's no reason to panic just yet about this company's ability to perform in the new year. The worst of the patent cliff is over for Pfizer, after plunging revenue to former top-selling drug Lipitor slammed sales last year. Expect those losses to ease in the new year, while up-and-coming drugs such as Xeljanz and Eliquis, which struggled to gain much traction last year, should start to garner momentum in 2014.

Investors spent the week waiting eagerly for the U.S. Labor Department's latest nonfarm payroll report, which most economists estimated would show 200,000 jobs created in December. But the release this morning indicated that only 74,000 new jobs had been created last month. To make things worse, the labor force participation rate fell from 63% in November to 62.8% in December, which played a part in pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.7%, from its previous 7% resting spot.  
This worse-than-expected news has caused rising negative sentiments throughout the markets, and as of 1:05 p.m. EST the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down 40 points, or 0.24%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both down 0.08.
The Dow's biggest loser at this time is Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) which is off by 1.9%. The drop comes after the oil and gas giant released an interim update on its fourth-quarter earnings. Management expects earnings to be comparable to the year-ago quarter, as U.S. net oil-equivalent production is slightly lower, but has been offset by higher natural gas prices domestically. The company has been dealing with asset price fluctuations all quarter, both here at home and internationally, and those changes may end up hurting the company's profits this quarter.  
Outside the Dow, homebuilders are rallying today, as DR Horton (NYSE:DHI
) is up 2.6%, Lennar (NYSE:LEN
) is up 2.6%, and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM
) is up 2%. These moves higher are likely due to the weak jobs data released this morning.The Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will base part of its decision to slow its asset purchasing program and let interest rates rise on strengthening jobs numbers. Additionally, the data released today pushed U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year falling from 2.97% to 2.88% and the 30-year down from 3.88% to 3.81%. This lowering of the Treasury yield will also help homebuilders by pushing mortgage rates lower, making it more affordable for American's to buy homes.

After pinning their hopes on aspirations for an unequivocally positive employment report, bullish investors made their disappointment obvious after the actual Labor Department numbers this morning were much less encouraging. The unemployment rate did plunge from 7% to 6.7% in December, but the nearly half a million people who left the labor force was the primary reason for that decline. Gains of just 74,000 nonfarm payroll jobs sent the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) down 40 points as of 11 a.m. EST, with early morning indications of a substantial rise for the Dow disappearing after the report. Yet in looking at declines of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH
), and other stocks, it's important to look beyond the impact of the jobs data to see other causes for the drop.
For instance, Chevron fell 1.6% after issuing its interim update last night, which included preliminary results for the fourth quarter. The oil giant said earnings would be roughly flat compared to the third quarter, with rising net income from downstream refining and marketing operations offsetting weakness in upstream exploration and production activity. In particular, falling oil and liquids production in the U.S. more than offset a slight climb in natural gas production domestically, while a much larger plunge in natural gas production overseas offset a modest climb in oil and liquids volume. Moreover, substantial sequential drops in oil prices, as well as international natural gas realizations, could hurt dollar revenue as well.
Meanwhile, UnitedHealth dropped 1.3%. Rival insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM
) said late yesterday that it sees unfavorable trends among those enrolling in private plans through Obamacare health-insurance exchanges, pointing to the ability of some customers to retain their nonexchange insurance coverage. The news confirms worries throughout the industry that weak enrollment figures suggested that insurers weren't seeing the ideal mix of healthier and less healthy enrollees. Further evidence could cause problems for every insurance company in the industry.
Still, not all the news was bad. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC
) rose 1.7% despite news that PC shipments worldwide fell another 10% during 2013. Yet investors have to remember that at some point, the rate of decline becomes more important than the fact of the decline, and even a slower fall in PC demand could lead to positive surprises for Intel. In that light, any successes Intel has on the mobile front could represent icing on the cake for investors.
