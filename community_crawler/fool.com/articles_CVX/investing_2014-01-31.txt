It was another bad day on Wall Street as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) lost 149 points, or 0.94%, the S&P 500 fell 0.65%, and the Nasdaq declined 0.47%. Those moves came despite the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment figure hitting 81.2 for January, which is better than the preliminary monthly reading, at 80.4. But even though the figure rose during the month, it was still below the 82.5 from December.
One big winner within the Dow was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT
), as shares rose 2.66%. The move came after reports began to break that the company's search for a new CEO was over. It's believed that Microsoft veteran Satya Nadella would be taking over the top job when current CEO Steve Ballmer hangs up his hat. Shares have been languishing for some time as investors anxiously awaited an announcement of who would take over the job. After Ford's CEO Alan Mulally publicly announced he would not be taking the job, shares fell a few percent, so today's move higher shouldn't really be considered a win, just a move back to even.
On the other side of the coin, shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), and Visa (NYSE:V
) all helped pull the blue chip index lower today as they fell 4.14%, 1.95%, and 2.47%, respectively. Not only were these three stocks big percentage losers today, but due to their share prices, the three represent 17.48% of the Dow; when they fall, the overall index likely follows, as it did today.
The oil stocks fell after Chevron reported earnings this morning and reported a 32% decline to net earnings after revenue dropped 4% during the quarter when compared to the same time period last year. The drop was the result of lower global fuel prices and a decline in overall production. The company is looking to cut costs by roughly $2 billion in the coming year, but it's future production and profits are not very clear at this time; increased uncertainty means a lower stock price. 
ExxonMobil and Visa were both victims of their industry today. Chevron's poor performance raised concerns from Exxon investors about how it will deal with the future, while Visa's drop came after MasterCard reported earnings that missed on both the top and bottom lines, but more importantly saw a 21% increase on the expense line. A large part of that increase came from litigation expenses and, while this may be an issue only MasterCard is experiencing, it could be something the whole credit card industry will have to deal with in the future.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Today is a great reminder of why the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES:^DJI
) movements can be deceptive to the average investor. While the Dow has dropped 65points as of 2:30 p.m. EST, the price-weighted nature of the index means that the stocks with the highest prices have the most impact on the daily shifts. Enter Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and Visa, two-high priced blue-chip stocks that have hit big slumps today, respectively losing 3.5% and 2%, and have transformed a so-so day from the rest of the Dow into a bad one for the index. Meanwhile, Dow component Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT
) has gained about  2.3%. Let's catch up on what you need to know.
Chevron's earnings disappoint
Chevron's drop comes after the energy giant released quarterly earnings this morning. The Big Oil company announced a 32% fall in net earnings, with revenue down more than 4% year over year behind weaker production and falling global crude prices. Overall production at the company slid to 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, leading to a miss on both the bottom and top lines on analyst projections. Chevron's looking to cut capital expenditure by $2 billion in the new year to compensate, but investors in this big oil company are presently looking toward a future with murky demand and cloudy prospects.
Some of the biggest news around the Dow has come from today's index leader. Reports emerged late yesterday that Microsoft has selected company veteran Satya Nadella as its new CEO, ending a months-long chase to find a new leader for the company in the wake of Steve Ballmer's announced retirement.
Nadella, who leads Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, could bring a conservative leadership style and stable approach to the company as a decades-long insider. His grip on online services comes as Microsoft's traditional business and software divisions look to keep growth coming at the company, although Nadella will quickly face the challenge of keeping Microsoft's nascent consumer business on the upswing. Microsoft more than doubled its Surface tablet sales in the most recent quarter sequentially, but that still hasn't been enough to boost the company's push to join the clear leaders in the mobile space.
Perhaps the biggest news on the markets today comes from outside the Dow. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN
) stock has plunged nearly 10% after the company reported earnings of its own yesterday following the closing bell. Amazon missed analyst projections on both the top and bottom lines despite a 20% growth in quarterly revenue and a 22% growth in full-year revenue for 2013. That's pushed the company to consider a possible Amazon Prime price as the company looks to maintain its dominance while bringing in more cash. So far, it hasn't impressed investors today.

The challenges facing Big Oil showed up loud and clear this morning when Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) reported earnings that fell well short of expectations. Fourth-quarter revenue dropped 7.3% to $56.2 billion and net income was down 32% to $4.93 billion, or $2.57 per share. Earnings hit estimates from Wall Street but revenue was way short of the $64.9 billion analysts expected.  
Pressure came from across the business. Exploration and production earnings were down 29%, hurt by rising costs and falling oil prices. What's concerning is that low margins in exploration didn't translate to higher margins downstream, which saw a 58% drop in profit.
Oil companies are stuck between a rock and a hard place with exploration costs rising and the price of gasoline not rising at the same pace. That puts pressure on exploration or refining profits, depending on where the price of oil is in any given quarter. This quarter, conditions were bad enough to sink both upstream and downstream profits for Chevron.
Outside of a sharp rise in the price of gasoline, Chevron and other big oil companies are in for steadily declining profits long term. The developed world is using less oil than it did a decade ago and isn't willing to pay for gasoline the way it once was. This is still a dominant energy player but its dominance will slowly fade with time.

The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) are closing out January just as the month began: with a triple-digit loss. This morning, stocks dropped on concerns on multiple fronts, with the Dow falling 170 points as of 11 a.m. EST. An earnings warning from retail juggernaut Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT
) and ill-received results from energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) must take some of the blame. On the economic front, a third-straight monthly drop in the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index pointed to choppiness in the U.S. economy, and a key reading of consumer sentiment dropped in January from the previous month's levels. At the same time, ongoing stresses in emerging-market economies could lead to further central bank action to stem the threat of trouble spreading into other countries. With the Dow slated to post a huge loss for January, many wonder if the stock market is doomed to poor performance in 2014.
At current levels, the Dow has lost almost 900 points this month, and unless the average recovers later today, investors will finally have the 5% blue-chip index correction that many have been anticipating. With so much volatility in the market lately, it's easy for investors to conclude that the time is ripe to get out of stocks with the lion's share of their gains over the past five years.
But when you look at individual stocks within the Dow, you get two different pictures of the market. On one hand, Chevron is driving today's losses, with a 32% drop in earnings coming from lower oil prices and falling production both domestically and worldwide. Coming on the heels of rival ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM
) earnings report yesterday, the challenges that huge oil companies are having in maintaining production levels as energy prices fall could continue to impact the market throughout the year. So far, those concerns really haven't spread to most of the smaller energy companies that have driven the U.S. boom in energy production, but the entire industry is sensitive to changing market conditions for crude oil and natural gas products.
On the other hand, one surprising winner today is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
), which is up almost 1%. The heavy-equipment maker has suffered from poor economic prospects for China and other key markets for a long time, but shareholders are increasingly optimistic that the worst could be over for the company. Optimism about Caterpillar points to the potential for the entire stock market to rebound even if January's mini-correction turns into more extensive losses in future months, as long as a market decline doesn't reverse the macroeconomic progress that the U.S. has seen since the 2008 recession ended.
Investors shouldn't conclude that the Dow will have a down 2014 just because of January's results. But they should also be prepared for what would be a natural loss for stocks after five consecutive years of gains. By preparing for all eventualities, investors can position themselves to take maximum advantage of whatever conditions they face in 2014.
