After falling 30% overnight, oil prices settled 24% lower Monday after the OPEC+ meeting last week ended without an agreement for production cuts. Saudi Arabia, the world's lowest cost producer, announced sharp discounts last night for April contracts, in an apparent bid to force Russia's hand, after the meeting Friday of oil cartel OPEC and its allies, ended without a deal. 
After Russia rejected a proposed 1.5 million barrel per day production cut on Thursday from the OPEC leader, Saudi Arabia announced price discounts over the weekend, and the intent to increase production from its current 9.7 million to over the 10 million barrel-per-day level, according to Reuters.

The onset of the price war caused the commodity to plunge the most since the Gulf War in 1991, amid a still unknown level of demand drop resulting from the economic impacts of the spread and containment attempts related to the coronavirus. 
With the supply increase, and full Saudi capacity reportedly at 12.5 million barrels per day, energy stocks plunged across the board on Monday. Exploration and production companies including Apache Corp. (NASDAQ:APA), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) sank around 50% on the day. 
Majors including ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), BP (NYSE:BP), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) also each dropped double digits on the day. Traders are now watching to see whether Saudi Arabia and Russia reach a "Hail Mary" deal and what the reaction will be from U.S. producers to try and support prices.

The S&P 500 fell more than 7.5% on Monday, its worst single day decline since December 2008, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,000 points on a day dominated by increasing COVID-19 coronavirus-related concerns, plunging interest rates, and falling oil prices.
What began as a spat between Saudi Arabia and Russia over the weekend caused crude oil prices to post their largest single-day declines since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, sending shares of oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) down more than 12% apiece. Financials were also among the big losers weighing on the Dow, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) down 14.7% and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) down 13.5%, pressured by 10-year Treasury yields falling to below 0.5% midday.

The market was already reeling from coronavirus concerns, and there was nothing over the weekend to suggest the outbreak related panic was misguided or overdone. Markets seem to be pricing in a potential outbreak-induced recession into many industrial sectors, fearful that supply chain disruptions and poor demand will eat into future results.
Markets were in sell-mode from the open, with the exchanges halted four minutes into the trading day with stocks already down 7%, triggering a circuit breaker designed to calm investors.
It all adds up to a market that for years was able to shrug off bad news suddenly becoming overwhelmed with negative headlines, and investors rushing for the exits. With the declines the S&P 500 is now just barely above breakeven for the last year, giving up a 28% gain in calendar 2019.

The stock market was in full-blown panic mode on Monday, with steep declines in all the major indexes triggering a brief halt to trading after circuit breaker rules were activated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down 5.5% at 10:40 a.m. EDT.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was having a particularly rough day, with shares hit by the broad market sell-off as well as reports that a wiring fix may be necessary for the grounded 737 Max. Oil majors Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) also tumbled following some weekend turmoil in the oil markets.

Shares of plane manufacturer and defense company Boeing were down 8.4% Monday morning. While the steep stock market sell-off was behind some of the losses, there was some bad news for the company over the weekend.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Boeing's proposal to avoid shifting wires in the grounded 737 Max had not won support from U.S. regulators. In January, The New York Times reported that Boeing had found a wiring issue with the 737 Max. Two bundles of wires were too close together, which created a risk of a short circuit that could down the plane.
The Federal Aviation Administration reportedly does not agree with the company's assessment that the current wiring configuration meets safety standards. The agency is now likely to order Boeing to relocate the wires, which could further delay the return of the 737 Max to the skies.
Once Boeing does get the troubled plane flying again, the airline industry may look very different than it did just a few months ago. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is disrupting international travel, and multiple U.S. airlines have been warning about significant declines in demand. It remains to be seen how this will affect demand for commercial jets in the long run.
Shares of Chevron and ExxonMobil were down big Monday morning as oil prices crashed due to developments over the weekend. A deal between Russia and members of OPEC to reduce production fell apart when Russia refused further cuts. That prompted Saudi Arabia to ramp up production and cut prices in retaliation, initiating a full-blown price war.
Indexes that track crude oil prices were down double-digit percentages in the morning. Chevron stock was down 10.2%, while Exxon stock was down 7.7%. The chaos injected into the global oil market threatens U.S. shale producers, and it could have major impacts on banks that lend heavily to the energy industry, as well as other companies dependent on oil production.
Lower oil prices are not good news for Chevron and Exxon. The stocks have already been tumbling as the coronavirus outbreak threatened to reduce demand. Now, on top of a potential demand shock, a glut of supply is pushing down prices.
How all of this ends is anyone's guess. For investors in Chevron and Exxon, it's certainly going to be a rough ride.
