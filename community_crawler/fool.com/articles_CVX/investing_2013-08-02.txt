Despite a disappointing jobs report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) gained over the course of the session after to finish up 30 points, or 0.2%. The Department of Labor reported just 162,000 jobs were added in July, short of economists' prediction of 175,000, while private sector job growth, which has been stronger than overall growth due to cuts in the public sector, was just 161,000, or 34,000 below estimates. Still, the unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low of 7.4%, but that was due to a decline in the size of the workforce and the number of people looking for jobs, rather than a meaningful addition of new jobs.
Ironically, the main reason for the Dow's gain today seemed to be the market's reaction to the negative jobs report. Benchmark treasury yields fell 4.4%, indicating that investors are more confident that the Fed will delay its plan to taper its bond-buying program. In fact, several major banks changed their projection for the start of the taper from September to December. It seems to be a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose world for investors these days, as the markets reacted warmly to both good and bad economic news. Investors interpret good news straightforwardly, while bad news means the Fed will keep pouring money into the economy and keeping interest rates down. Both the Dow and S&P 500 finished at all-time highs today.
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) was the big winner on the Dow this Firday, finishing 2.9% higher. The PC maker may have benefited from rival Dell jumping 5.6%, as CEO and Founder Michael Dell sweetened his buyout offer by adding a one-time dividend to his proposed offer price of $13.75 a share. Mr. Dell has been fighting activist investor Carl Icahn to take the company private in recent months. Today's jump is a reminder that investors still see value in the PC market, which could stoke demand for an HP buyout, or a higher price for its assets. The stock also appeared to jump on rumors, later claimed to be untrue, that Icahn had taken a stake in HP. At one point today, the PC maker was up over 5%.
A day after being one of the Dow's few losers in yesterday's rally as interest rates jumped, Home Depot (NYSE:HD
) moved up 2% today as rates fell. As its business is heavily dependent on the housing market, rising mortgage rates are a bane for the home-improvement retailer, as they could cool off the real estate recovery. Thanks to the strong housing market, Home Depot shares are up more than 30% this year.
Finally, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) fell 1.2% after its earnings report, like Exxon's yesterday, failed to impress. Lower oil prices were the culprit, again, as profits at the energy giant declined 26% from a year ago, to $5.37 billion, or $2.77 a share. That missed the analyst consensus at $2.97.  Revenue also dropped 8%, to $57.37 billion, but that topped estimates of $56.01 billion. Repair and maintenance work on refineries was also listed as a cause for the smaller profits, but oil and gas production was down 1.6%, an industrywide trend for the majors. Still, with oil prices back up over $100, Chevron should have a better quarter next time around.

You might think that fresh news of anemic jobs growth would send stocks spiraling downwards... and for good reason. But Wall Street couldn't fully get on board with that logic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
), after initially falling on weak July payrolls data, rallied nearly 100 points from its morning lows to close at a record high. The reasoning? A fragile jobs market means there's more stimulus ahead. With that optimistic mind-set, the Dow ended with 30-point gains, rising 0.2%, to end at 15,658.
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) posted the largest gains in the index, advancing 2.9%, the stock's second straight day of 2% returns. Today's bullishness can be chalked up to a bevy of rumors and nonspecific developments (a few of the less-persuasive catalyst types, to be sure). Talk that activist investor Carl Icahn has a stake in HP drove the stock up, but were swiftly denied, only to be replaced by rumors that the company is working on a new smartphone. HP also dropped a price-fixing lawsuit against several Asian companies, though we don't know what type of remuneration, if any, it received for dropping the charges.
Agricultural heavyweight E.I. du Pont de Nemours (NYSE:DD
) jumped 2.5% as Wall Street continued to applaud the company's recently closed, hard-fought acquisition of South Africa's Pannar Seed. The purchase, completed on Wednesday after years of pushback from South African regulators, gives DuPont a new outlet for growth, and further diversifies its operations. The exact terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
Following up poor earnings from Exxon yesterday, fellow energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) also disappointed, falling 1.2%, as oil prices declined. Revenue fell 8% in the second quarter, but Chevron really saw profits fall, as they dipped 26% from the same quarter a year ago. With per-barrel prices of oil in the U.S. down from $97 a year ago, to just $92 in the second quarter this year, Chevron was bound to get hit financially as the oil and gas sector ended as the worst in the markets today. 
Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH
) was the Dow's biggest laggard, slumping 1.2% Friday. Healthcare providers as a whole didn't wow anybody today, with most of the money in the markets going to consumer services and technology. On the year, UnitedHealth shareholders have been amply rewarded -- shares are up 33 in 2013 as the health-care sector has surged.

It's jobs report Friday, and the Department of Labor has reported that the U.S. economy added 162,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate fell to 7.4%. That's not a fabulous growth rate, and it won't bring a quick economic recovery, but it also isn't all that surprising. Economists were expecting 180,000 jobs to be added, so the report is well within the margin of error and is approximately in line with the past two years. 
Stock markets didn't have much of a reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down a meaningless two points late in trading, and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) isn't moving any further. However, the 10-year Treasury Note yield fell 10 basis points to 3.69% on speculation that weak jobs numbers will keep the Fed's stimulus in place. 
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) is the big winner on the Dow today, jumping 2.9%. There were early reports that Carl Icahn had taken a stake in the company, but CNBC is now reporting that he doesn't own shares in the company. In related news, Dell (NASDAQ:DELL.DL
) appears close to a buyout offer that increases the offer price to $13.75 per share, including a $0.13 special dividend and an $0.08 dividend for the third quarter.
The battle over Dell is an incremental positive for HP because it keeps the competitor distracted while HP attempts its turnaround. But the bottom line is that both companies are in a declining PC market, and I wouldn't expect growth to pick up anytime soon.
The other big mover is Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), which has fallen 1.6% following a disappointing earnings report. Net income dropped 26% in the second quarter versus the prior-year period, and revenue was down 8%. The company blamed lower oil prices and falling margins in the refining business for its struggles. In the long term, Big Oil will continue to struggle because consumer demand isn't increasing and it's becoming harder and more expensive to find oil. Both factors will put pressure on oil companies, and we could see profit continue to decline as the world looks to alternative energy sources for a growing portion of demand.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) has managed to bounce back to breakeven today after starting the day deep in the red. As of 2:15 p.m. EDT the blue-chip index is down a mere five points. The index has climbed almost all the way back from the morning's losses, however, and as of 2:15 p.m. EDT it's hanging just below the flat mark. Big Oil's two Dow companies, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), reported earnings today, and neither one could post strong enough numbers to satisfy Wall Street -- or keep their stocks out of the red. Let's check out their earnings and the other big stories around the Dow you need to know.
Jobs growth slows, Big Oil falls
The July jobs report kicked things off on a sour note this morning, as new jobs picked up by only 162,000 for the month. That was far below many economists' predictions, even as unemployment dropped further to 7.4% in July. The labor force and labor participation rate both declined for the month, allowing the unemployment rate to fall despite the smaller-than-expected number of new jobs. Still, there were good signs for the economy in the month: Consumer spending moved higher by 0.5%, according to the Department of Commerce.
Those numbers weren't much help to Big Oil investors. Among the Dow's oil majors, Chevron has taken the brunt of the losses today, with shares falling 1.7% to lead the index lower. Cheaper oil prices contributed to the drop in the company's earnings, which declined by 26% year over year and missed analyst expectations. Chevron's revenue also dropped significantly, falling by more than 8% for the quarter.
Chevron's downstream segment really took a beating this quarter: The division's net profit plunged by 59% year over year. Despite a rise in natural-gas prices, it's oil that drives Chevron's business -- and the increase in U.S. shale oil production has cut oil prices from their recent highs. It has also cut down on Chevron's production, which is around 70,000 barrels per day below the company's production target of 2.65 million bpd for this year.
Exxon wasn't spared the pain of its smaller rival: The firm's net earnings plummeted by 57% year over year. Part of that loss owed to favorable tax breaks and other items that bolstered earnings a year ago, but smaller margins and cheaper oil are hitting Exxon's business as well. Revenue plunged 16% -- far more than at Chevron.
Although Exxon's earnings fell short of analysts' expectations, CEO Rex Tillerson expressed optimism today, calling the results representative of "strong operational performance." As with Chevron, Exxon's production is on the downswing. The metric fell for the eighth straight month, this time at a 1.9% year-over-year clip.
On the other side of the Dow, chemical giant DuPont (NYSE:DD
) is up 1.8% due to continued optimism from earlier in the week when the company announced it had completed its long and drawn-out acquisition of South African seed firm Pannar. South Africa had resisted DuPont's takeover attempt, but the three-year journey has finally come to an end -- much to DuPont investors' delight. The company has transitioned more toward higher-growth agricultural sales recently, and Pannar should only help DuPont's attempts to rise up the sector's ranks.

This morning's all-important July jobs report certainly wasn't what investors were expecting it to be, as only 162,000 new jobs were added to the U.S. economy during the month. That's the worst number we've seen in four months and well below the 185,000 that economists were expecting. Additionally, May and June were revised lower by a total of 26,000 jobs, and the labor force participation rate fell from 63.5% to 63.4%. Finally, while the unemployment rate did decline to 7.4%, that owes partly to a decline in the labor participation rate. 
As this news hit investors this morning, the markets suffered more substantial losses, but they have since made their way back near breakeven. After being down more than 70 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is off by only 12 points, or 0.08%, as of 12:50 p.m. EDT. The S&P 500 is down less than a point, while the Nasdaq is now up about 0.1%. But despite coming off its lows, 17 of the Dow's 30 components are still in the red today. Let's take a moment to see why a few of them are lower.
Shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are down 2.4% today after the company reported second-quarter earnings this morning that, similar to ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM
) results yesterday, didn't impress. Chevron reported revenue of $57.37 billion, which was down 8.4% from the second quarter last year and was much better than the 16.4% revenue decline Exxon experienced this year when compared to 2012. Chevron's earnings came in at $2.77 per share, down 24% from $3.66 a year ago -- a discouraging result but still much better than Exxon's 54% profit decline. Chevron's operating margins fell from 19.6% to 15% during the quarter, but one of the biggest problems was that the company's downstream segment -- refining, marketing, and chemical operations -- experienced a profit decline of 59% as higher costs and lower margins hurt those units. Shares of ExxonMobil are down 1.3% today after falling just more than 1% yesterday.
Similar to Exxon and Chevron, IBM (NYSE:IBM
) is a Dow component that has a lot of influence on which way the index moves, as it's the heaviest-weighted component. As it slides lower by 0.8% today, it's holding the blue-chip index lower. It was recently announced that IBM is losing a big customer, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor. IBM was paid $106.9 million to help the state fix some problems with its unemployment compensation programs from 2006 until September this year. But the state agency now says IBM's project is behind schedule, over budget, and ineffective. An IBM spokesperson nonetheless expressed surprise that the Pennsylvania Department of Labor will not renew the contract and said IBM was willing to work with the state to resolve the project's issues.  
Shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC
) are down 0.8%, which could be the result of a report from The Wall Street Journal indicating that the bank is planning to change its fee structure within Merrill Lynch. Currently, the advisors themselves set the prices wealth-management clients pay, but the bank is considering going to a more structured system in which some clients will pay as much as 50% more for the same services they are already receiving. We have seen in the past when Bank of America announced new checking-account fees a major uproar from clients, and these new fees may cause the same kind of outrage and customer disbursement, which could cost the company more than it will make on the increased fees.

After yesterday's big record push for the stock market, stocks are pulling back modestly today. Most analysts are pointing to economic data as justifying the pullback, with the latest figures from the federal government showing employment growth of just 162,000 jobs in July -- its lowest level in four months. Moreover, given a drop in labor participation and downward revisions for past months, it's far from clear whether rank-and-file Americans are truly benefiting from the recovery, even with the unemployment rate falling to 7.4%. By 10:55 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) were down 49 points, or 0.31%, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) slipped 0.21% but held above the 1,700 level it achieved for the first time yesterday.
But the real reason behind the Dow's uncertainty has to do with the varied situations of different companies. On one hand, this morning's earnings report from Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) sent the stock down 2%. The company's quarterly profit dropped 26%, falling far short of analyst expectations. This supports the idea that major oil and gas producers will face long-term challenges in sustaining the growth rates that the pace of new discoveries has created in the recent past. Given the extent to which the energy industry is seen driving a new era in American competitiveness, adverse trends that hurt energy companies are an important warning sign to consider not only for the industry, but for U.S. economic prospects more generally.
At the same time, though, some industries are looking a lot more favorable. DuPont (NYSE:DD
) added to its recent gains today, climbing more than 2% as investors continue to digest the possible implications of the company's purchase of a majority stake in South African company Pannar Seed. The agricultural industry has shown huge growth in the U.S., but the prospects in Africa are potentially even more lucrative, as untapped potential in the African ag market will require production-enhancing techniques in order to take maximum advantage. Such opportunities are likely why DuPont attracted the attention of investor Nelson Peltz, who reportedly bought a substantial position in DuPont recently. More broadly, they show the continuing promise of global growth as a key component of U.S. company strategy.
Investors also remain bullish about the prospects for technological advances throughout the economy. This morning LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD.DL
) has jumped almost 11% after it reported expectation-beating earnings and was upgraded by multiple brokers. LinkedIn reflects arguably the most successful impact that social media has had on the economy, helping facilitate employment opportunities and streamline hiring and job hunting. So long as tech companies find ways to improve aspects of people's everyday lives, the industry should continue doing its fair share to bolster overall growth.
So long as these dueling trends fight against each other, you can expect continued pullbacks in the bull market from time to time. Yet with the economy still improving -- albeit not so fast as many would like -- the general direction for stocks is likely to remain up, at least until early warning signs show up in more concrete adverse economic data.
