Units of midstream master limited partnership Noble Midstream Partners (NASDAQ:NBLX) jumped as much as 17% when the trading day began on July 20. By roughly 10:30 a.m. Wall Street time, it was still hanging on to most of those gains, up around 14%. There was no news out of Noble Midstream, but there was big news out of Chevron (NYSE:CVX) that could end up changing Noble Midstream's long-term outlook.
Noble Midstream is a partnership created by Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) to own and operate midstream energy assets, specifically pipelines. Noble Energy is the general partner, meaning it runs the partnership, and has a roughly 45% interest in Noble Midstream. All of this is relevant today because Noble Midstream's long-term growth is tied to the prospects for Noble Energy and the assets that the energy company is likely to sell to it (known as a dropdown in the industry). Specifically, Noble Midstream has the right of first refusal (ROFR) for five of Noble Energy's midstream assets.

On July 20, integrated oil giant Chevron announced that it was buying Noble Energy in an all-stock deal worth $5 billion. Noble Midstream isn't directly involved in this acquisition. But assuming the deal is consummated as planned, it would mean that Noble Midstream will end up being run by one of the largest and strongest energy companies in the world. That materially increases the likelihood that Noble Midstream's future will be a good one.   
There are a great many things that could happen from here, so the Chevron/Noble Energy deal itself probably isn't the best reason to buy Noble Midstream, even if it hints at a brighter future for the partnership. That's especially true given the swift unit-price advance of Noble Midstream in early trading. Indeed, the last time Chevron tried to buy a company, it was eventually outbid and the "winner" (Occidental Petroleum) ended up struggling to carry the debt it took on. If that were to happen here, then Noble Midstream's outlook would likely end up decidedly worse than it was prior to Chevron's announcement. Another option is that the deal simply falls through, which would leave Noble Midstream back where it started. Most investors should probably accept that they've missed the big gains here and reevaluate the name when Chevron's bid to buy Noble Energy has closed.

Shares of oil and gas driller Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) jumped 10% right out of the gate on July 20. That's not at all shocking given that integrated energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) agreed to buy the company. Here are the details.
In an all-stock deal, oil giant Chevron will pay $5 billion for Noble Energy. That works out to $10.38 per share, a roughly 7.5% premium over where the stock closed on July 17, the last trading day before the deal was announced. Noble Energy shareholders will receive 0.1191 shares of Chevron for each Noble Energy share they own.

Chevron noted that the acquisition will broaden its reach in the Mediterranean and augment its low-cost U.S. onshore portfolio at a price it considers attractive. Effectively, Chevron is using its size, financial strength, and global reach to make an opportunistic acquisition. Chevron's stock was down slightly on the announcement. 
The big question for Noble shareholders, however, is why did the target's stock rise more than 7.5%? The answer is likely that some investors think there will be another suitor willing to offer a higher price, much like what happened the last time Chevron tried to buy a company. In that case, Occidental Petroleum wound up the winner after Chevron backed out of the bidding. However, in the end, Occidental ended up overpaying and has been struggling to pay down deal debt since it acquired Anadarko Petroleum in the second half of 2019.   
When Occidental took on Chevron in an acquisition bid, the energy market was a very different place. Although it's nice to see Chevron flexing its muscles again, using stock and not cash, investors shouldn't rush in here thinking that the next step is a bidding war for Noble Energy. And, at this point, it looks like the news is largely priced into Noble Energy's shares. That said, by 10 a.m. Wall Street time, Noble Energy's stock was up just 6.5%, suggesting that a more rational mood has quickly developed here.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has agreed to acquire Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL) in an all-stock deal. The oil giant is paying $5 billion in stock for Noble and assuming all its debt, which pushes the total transaction value to $13 billion. 
Noble Energy investors will receive 0.1191 shares of Chevron for each share they currently hold, valuing them at $10.38 each. That implies a 12% premium to the 10-day average closing price.

Chevron sees several benefits to acquiring Noble Energy. The largest is the strong strategic fit, highlighted by 92,000 largely contiguous acres in the Permian Basin near Chevron's assets in the region. Chevron will also bolster its positions in the eastern Mediterranean and West Africa via Noble's offshore assets in Israel and Equatorial Guinea. And Noble Energy will enhance Chevron's North American onshore business by adding land in the DJ Basin and Eagle Ford as well as an integrated midstream business via its stake in Noble Midstream (NASDAQ:NBLX).
Chevron believes that the combined company will generate about $300 million of annual pre-tax savings. And it anticipates the transaction will be accretive to its return on capital employed, free cash flow, and earnings per share within one year of closing, assuming a $40 price on Brent crude.
Overall, the addition of Noble Energy accomplishes many of the same objectives of Chevron's failed attempt to acquire Anadarko Petroleum last year, but at a fraction of the cost. It's paying less than $5 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) for Noble's proven oil and gas reserves and less than $1.50 per BOE for its resource base of 7 billion BOE.
