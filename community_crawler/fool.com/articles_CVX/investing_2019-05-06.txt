It was somewhat of a manic Monday for the stock market. Driven by fears of a worsening trade war between the U.S. and China, investors sold off stocks, and the Dow Jones plunged by almost 500 points.
But then, news broke that a Chinese delegation was traveling to the U.S. to keep negotiations alive, and some of those fears dissipated. The stock index ended the day down "only" 66 points. The damage on the Nasdaq was more limited, with that exchange slipping by less than 1%.
As always, there were a few blue chips defying the downward Dow. Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) traded higher, albeit modestly. Clearly, at least some investors are impressed that its monster hit Avengers: Endgame is rapidly becoming the top-grossing film of all time.

Two other notable gainers were Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). Hoping to woo Anadarko away from Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Occidental pumped up its takeover bid for the company.
Avengers: Endgame, apparently the final installment in the long-running superhero saga from Disney unit Marvel Entertainment, cannot be stopped. In only its second week of release, it was not only the top worldwide grosser by far among all releases, but it's now also close to becoming the No. 1 of all time, behind only the 2009 sci-fi epic Avatar.
Although studio entertainment (i.e., the movie unit) isn't the largest of Disney's four divisions, it still matters -- in fiscal 2018, it was responsible for 17% of total revenue. So a monster box-office hit is a fine morale booster for shareholders.
Avengers: Endgame's success will add to the upward momentum the company's enjoying just now. Its massive acquisition of key 21st Century Fox assets closed earlier this year. And we're just in front of the opening of the hotly anticipated new theme-park land, the sure-to-be-popular Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.
Disney's uptick today is a sign that investors are focusing on the company's positive developments. That looks like it'll stay in force, although there are certain worries on the horizon -- longtime CEO Bob Iger's looming retirement, for one, and the recent lackluster performance of hoped-for blockbuster Dumbo.
If you think the price of gas is expensive at your local pump, spend some time in the C-suites of Anadarko and Occidental.
On Sunday, the latter company bolstered its buyout offer for Anadarko, lifting the cash portion of the bid to $59 per share. Combined with just under 0.3 shares of Occidental for one share of Anadarko, the total bid is $76 per share. That revised bid helped lift the prices of both stocks on Monday.
Chevron's offer currently amounts to a bit under $62 per share in cash and stock.
With the bid and its rhetoric, Occidental is making a concentrated effort to win the prize. In a press release, Occidental quoted CEO Vicki Hollub as saying that acquiring Anadarko "will create a global energy leader with the scale and geographic diversification to drive compelling returns to the shareholders of both companies."
Another big stock market name has skin in this game: Warren Buffett, through his investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire last week committed $10 billion in financial support for Occidental's bid. If the play is successful, Berkshire will receive 100,000 preferred shares in Occidental.
Occidental's bid is a strong and bold one, and its backed by the might of Buffett and Berkshire. Yet Chevron is a mighty beast on its own. We shouldn't be surprised if this buyout war rages on.

Shares of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) rose an incredible 60% in April, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It wasn't a smooth and steady climb, however. There were two discrete advances in the month, each of which was swift, dramatic, and driven by news.
On April 12, integrated energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) announced plans to buy Anadarko for $33 billion. That equated to roughly $65 per share. The price of Anadarko shot up from the mid-$40-per-share range to the low $60s, eventually getting to around $64 per share a few days later. With the proposed acquisition, Chevron was attempting to expand its U.S. onshore drilling business.

Later in the month, though, Anadarko got a second offer, this time from Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Occidental was basically looking to achieve the same ends as Chevron. After examining the counter offer, and despite a roughly $1 billion breakup fee included in the Chevron agreement, Anadarko agreed to further discussions with Occidental on a deal valued at roughly $76 per share. That news sent Anadarko's stock up again, as investors assumed that it would either consummate the new deal or, potentially, get an improved offer from Chevron.     
In early May, Anadarko agreed to a deal with Occidental valued at $76 per share. Anadarko shareholders will receive $59 in cash and 0.2934 shares of Occidental stock for each share of Anadarko they own.   
At this point, the fight for Anadarko appears to be over. Although it is possible that Chevron will make another offer, the difference in the price isn't likely to provide the huge gains that were seen in April. With the stock trading close to the final price offered by Occidental, conservative investors are probably better off selling Anadarko and locking in the gains. That said, if the idea of owning Occidental shares is enticing, then sitting tight would be a reasonable option, too. However, because part of the deal is tied to the value of Occidental shares, there is a very real risk that the end value of the deal could move lower if you decide to ride it out.
