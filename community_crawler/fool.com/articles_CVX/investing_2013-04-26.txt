The Commerce Department announced this morning that the U.S. economy grew by 2.5% in the first quarter of 2013. This was much better than the 0.4% growth we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2012, but not as high as the 3.1% that many economists had predicted. And after today's release, many began painting a less optimistic picture of 2013 than most had before, when they said this was as good as it would get this year.  
The GDP report and a number of earnings releases had investors confused on what to do, and the markets ended the day mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) closed higher by 11 points, or 0.08%, and now sits at 14,712, while both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were lower when the closing bell rang. The S&P lost 0.18% as the technology-heavy index fell 0.33%.
With the Dow hardly moving, it was easy to find a few winners and one big loser today.
Few Dow winners
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA
) moved higher by 1.29% today. The move came on the heels of an announcement out of Japan, where regulators have now officially approved the proposed 787 Dreamliner's battery fix. This is an important development, since half of the already 50 Dreamliners that have been delivered to clients are owned by Japanese airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Boeing has announced that it will take a few weeks for all the previously delivered planes to receive the approved changes to the aircrafts battery system, but this is a big step forward and soon the issue will be behind Boeing.  
Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) announced earnings this morning, and despite missing on revenue, the company beat earnings-per-share estimates. Analysts wanted to see $67.73 billion in sales, but Chevron reported only $56.82 billion. Earnings per share came in at $3.18, while estimates were only at $3.08. And even though operating margins fell from 19.9% to 18.1%, and production earnings slid 4.1%, shares rose 1.29% today, probably because oil and natural gas production increased by 0.8% during the quarter, which will truly help the company in the long run.  
One Dow loser
Shares of Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) fell 1.43% today as Standard & Poor's reduced the outlook for the stock from "stable" to "negative." S&P reaffirmed Alcoa's corporate credit score at BBB-, which is the lowest investment-grade level, but if aluminum prices and weak demand persist for longer than expected, it's not out of the realm of possibility that Alcoa could be reduced to junk status in the future.

Clarification:
Standard & Poor's reaffirmed the outlook for Alcoa but didn't reduce the company's credit rating.
With consumer confidence falling in April and gross domestic product in the first quarter coming in lower than expected, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) was lucky to eke out any gains at all today. It was the fourth gain in five days for blue chips, which had their worst week of the year last week but added back more than 1% as a flurry of earnings helped the comeback. The Dow ended up 11 points, or less than 0.1%, on Friday to close at 14,712. 
Wall Street thought Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) shares looked undervalued today, and even after adding 1.9% Friday, shares traded at less than six times forward earnings. Rebounding from losses yesterday, HP posted the highest gains in the index today. In recent years the company has felt the brutal impact of the PC market decline, and its stock took the biggest hit in the index last year. So while the bullishness of 2013 -- the stock is up more than 40% year to date -- reflects some optimism about CEO Meg Whitman's turnaround efforts, the stock is still rallying from fairly depressed levels. 
Yes, oil prices fell 7.5% across the globe, and yes, Chevron's (NYSE:CVX
) earnings dropped 4.5% in the first quarter, yet shares still added 1.3% today after the energy giant reported. While oil production slipped, increased traction in the natural gas business showed some promise, as natural gas sales rose 3.2%. 
BB&T upgraded its rating of Boeing's (NYSE:BA
) stock from a hold to a buy, and the aerospace giant responded by adding 1.3%. BB&T's new price target of $110 was echoed the day before by Barclays and its overweight rating on Boeing shares. Yesterday, Boeing received approval from the FAA for its 787 Dreamliner planes to return to the air for United Airlines.
Aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) ended as the worst performer in the index Friday, slipping 1.4% after slipping prices in the metal caused Standard & Poor's to downgrade the company's credit rating. Not good for Alcoa, which will have to pay a higher rate for money it wants to borrow going forward.

Often, news about growth in the U.S. economy ends up being the dominant theme for the day it comes out. Yet, despite some concerns about a weaker-than-expected GDP report, what really seemed to motivate investors today was the stream of earnings reports, and other individual-company events, that largely cancelled each other out. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) finished up just 12 points, while the S&P 500 went the other way, falling less than 0.2%.
Among the positive contributors to the Dow was Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), which climbed more than 1% after releasing earnings that beat expectations. Despite both revenue and income coming in with mid-single-digit percentage declines, the oil giant managed to increase its production volumes slightly, although not enough to offset falling prices for oil and gas. Unlike some of its peers, Chevron's refining division also suffered due to repairs and maintenance work; but, in the long run, the company appears better poised to deliver the growth it will need in order to sustain its massive energy portfolio.
Boeing (NYSE:BA
) also climbed, with a gain of nearly 1.5%, as investors welcomed news from Japanese authorities allowing its 787 Dreamliner aircraft to start flying again once installation of new battery systems is complete. With Japanese airlines playing a pivotal role in the 787's launch, the move should go a long way toward helping Boeing put the long grounding of the Dreamliner behind it.
Yet, Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) reminded investors that conditions aren't perfect within the Dow, as rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on the company's credit rating to negative. With Alcoa just barely clinging to the lowest investment-grade rating of BBB-, S&P cited weak aluminum prices and poor demand as affecting the quality of its debt. If the move is followed by a downgrade in the future, it could have an impact on what the company pays for new financing in the future.
Finally, 3M (NYSE:MMM
) fell another 1%, following through on larger losses yesterday in the wake of its poor forward guidance in its quarterly report. As Fool contributor and 3M-stock specialist Travis Hoium noted earlier today, 3M simply hasn't been able to restart its innovation engines to produce organic growth, and unless that happens, the stock's big advance could easily reverse itself in the near future.

Blue-chip stocks are narrowly holding onto gains this afternoon following a big week for earnings, and a critical announcement about the health of the economy. With less than an hour left in the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is up by 10 points, or 0.07%.
Fueling the market today was an announcement from the Commerce Department that GDP grew by 2.5% in the first three months of the year. As my colleague John Divine discussed earlier this morning, the economy was aided by an uptick in personal consumption expenditures, which improved by 3.2% in the quarter. Growth was nevertheless weighed down by a decrease in government spending, which shrank by 8.4% over the same time period.
All in all, as the market's reaction demonstrates, the news was positive. It was a dramatic improvement, for instance, over the fourth quarter of last year, during which real GDP grew at an annual rate of only 0.4%. However, it's always important to remember that the first estimate of GDP is just that -- an estimate. To John's point, revisions typically differ from advance estimates by half a percentage point.
In terms of individual stocks, shares of Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are headed higher in afternoon trading after the oil giant reported first-quarter earnings (link opens PDF) before the bell. While the oil giant saw its revenue and net income decline by 6.4% and 4.5%, respectively, its earnings per share managed to come in ahead of estimates. For the three months ended March 31, the company earned $3.31 per share compared to the consensus estimate of $3.09 per share. Like ExxonMobil, which reported yesterday, Chevron's top and bottom lines were the latest victims of falling global oil prices.
Also headed higher today are shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA
), which are currently up by 1.4%. The move comes on the heels of Japan's announcement that the company's flagship 787 Dreamliner should soon be cleared to fly again, after its battery fix was approved by regulators in that country. On its conference call two days ago, Boeing's CEO expressed optimism that the problem will soon be in the rearview mirror, and that 787 deliveries will begin again in May.
Meanwhile, shares of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ
) are leading the Dow higher, up 3.1% at the time of writing. There doesn't seem to be any specific impetus for the move, and volume is in line with the average. Bloomberg News published an interesting article on the company this morning, noting that it published a list of the 195 smelters that supply materials for HP computers. As the news agency pointed, out, this is a rare occurrence given that the smelting stage is "where some of the most abhorrent labor violations and corrupt business activity can take place."

Alternatively, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM
) continue to drag on the blue-chip index. The industrial conglomerate reported its earnings yesterday, sending shares in the company down nearly 3%. Like many of its peers on the Dow, 3M saw its revenue decline on a year-over-year basis, and felt compelled to lower its forward earnings guidance for the remainder of the year.

The economy grew at a relatively brisk 2.5% rate in the first quarter, but analysts had expected 3% growth and the result is a mild sell-off on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is off just 0.06% today and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is down 0.42%. Investors are also in a cautious mood because the University of Michigan-Thomson Reuters consumer sentiment gauge fell to 76.4 in April, the lowest since January, when tax increases took effect.  
The numbers didn't look great today, but looking closer at GDP, we see that personal consumption grew 3.2% and government spending was a drag on GDP. These are two long-term positive trends for the economy because they show some strength in the consumer and more spending restraint by the government.  
Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is up 0.7% today after reporting first-quarter earnings. Net income fell 4.5% to $6.18 billion, or $3.18 per share, but that was ahead of estimates and that's why the stock is moving higher. The company increased oil production in the quarter but lower oil prices were a drag on earnings. Oil companies can be volatile quarter to quarter, but this is a stable business for investors with a long-term view.  
Boeing (NYSE:BA
) jumped 1.5% after Japan officially approved the company's 787 Dreamliner battery fix. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines own about half of the 787s delivered so far so this will bring most of the fleet back to the skies -- eventually. Fixes to the batteries will take until the end of next month so it will be summer before all of Japan's fleet is ready to go. This headache for investors appears to be behind us and now we can focus on earnings, which were very solid in the first quarter.
