Major geopolitical events demand attention from investors, and they almost inevitably produce big whipsaws in both directions as tempers flare and then calm again. The stock market today reflected the general uncertainty about not only Syria but also various macroeconomic factors that could have an influence on international relations in both the economic and political spheres. After climbing nearly 100 points in the late-morning hours, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) had to be content with a gain of just 16 points.
But even more striking was the fact that many of the stocks that jumped the most earlier in the week when Syrian tensions reached their peak became some of today's worst performers. Oil stocks ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) led the Dow lower, posting losses of 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively. Oil fell nearly $2 per barrel to drop below the $110 level as some traders mulled the possibility that the U.S. and other countries might pull back from threats of military action in Syria. Moreover, with supplies of natural gas in the U.S. coming in above expectations, the integrated energy companies saw some of the excitement about the potential for further price gains for energy products dissipate.
Similarly, Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) fell 1.5%. Earlier this week, Alcoa and other major aluminum producers reportedly tried to negotiate with Japanese metal buyers for premiums for aluminum shipments of $250 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2013, which is the same level agreed to for the current quarter. Yet with the key Chinese market remaining weak, it's hard to see catalysts that will send the aluminum maker higher anytime in the near future.
Finally, beyond the Dow, The Fresh Market (NASDAQ: TFM) fell 12% on disappointing earnings news. Even though the company met expectations for its second quarter and saw same-store sales rise 3.4%, the company's guidance for earnings for the rest of the year was mostly below what investors had expected to see. With the stock having soared during 2013, shareholders clearly wanted unequivocally positive results. More patient investors might well end up being rewarded for being willing to wait a bit longer for faster growth from Fresh Market.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
On Tuesday it seemed like the world was about to end when the U.S. threatened a military strike against Syria. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) fell 170 points, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) dropped 26 points, and it appeared a market pullback was as imminent as air strikes in the Middle East. But the market is incredibly unpredictable, and stocks are up for a second day in a row, though only marginally: The Dow is up 0.09% late in trading, and the S&P 500 up 0.17%. Just goes to show that timing the market on a day-to-day basis can be a fool's errand.
The two data points helping stocks today are a 6,000-person drop in jobless claims to 331,000 last week and a second-quarter GDP revision up to 2.5% from 1.7%. Neither results are earth-shaking, but a slow and steady improvement in the economy is about all we can expect right now. 
The up-and-down gyrations of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) continued today, with the stocks falling 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively. Yesterday the stocks rose on higher oil prices, but I warned that higher prices may not actually lead to higher profits, and today that realization, along with oil's 1.1% drop to less than $109, has killed the energy exuberance. I'd be careful buying Big Oil stocks just because oil is up, because these companies also need higher gas prices to generate profits, and gas prices haven't kept up with oil in recent weeks.
The big mover on the Dow is Verizon (NYSE:VZ
), up 2.7% on speculation that it will finally complete a buyout of the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone. This deal has been discussed for years, but there's increasing urgency because interest rates are rising and Verizon could soon be unable to borrow enough to complete a deal. The rumored buyout figure is $130 billion, which I think favors Vodafone but will be a long-term positive for both sides. I don't think Verizon will pop when a deal is announced, so waiting to buy into the Verizon Wireless buyout until after terms are announced won't likely cost investors much.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
Stocks have fallen back from earlier highs in today's market session, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) has stayed in the green all day. As of 2:15 p.m. EDT, the Dow has picked up modest gains of more than 40 points. Most stocks aren't going anywhere fast today, but the majority of the Dow's blue-chip members are rising. Verizon (NYSE:VZ
) has done the heavy lifting for the Dow today after news about a potentially huge deal sent shares of the telecom leader surging. Let's catch up on the stock action you need to know about.
Verizon and Vodafone get down to business
Verizon's shares are up 2.6% today to lead the Dow after Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD
) announced that it is talking with the telecom company about selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. Verizon Wireless has surged in the U.S. to become the country's top wireless network by subscribers. Verizon is looking to control the full share of this lucrative business, rather than missing out while Vodafone capitalizes.
However, a deal won't come cheap: According to sources referenced by Bloomberg, such a sale could end up at a mind-blowing $130 billion. Vodafone's stock has surged more than 7.5% on the news. It's a hefty price to pay, but for Verizon, which gained about 66% of its revenue last year from its wireless business, it's a chance to take over a dominant leadership role in the U.S. market and pull far ahead of rival AT&T, which controls the country's second-largest wireless network.
The U.S. mobile market might be somewhat saturated in an age when everyone seems to have a wireless phone, but with more and more devices using wireless connectivity, Verizon sees plenty of strength to come in future quarters.
The Dow's losers are a small group today, but Big Oil giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are leading the holdouts down, losing 1.6%and 0.9%, respectively. The escalating Syrian crisis has sent crude-oil prices surging in the past few days, although the Middle Eastern nation is only a minor producer of oil compared to some of the largest producers. However, rising tensions and potential instability make the Middle East a volatile place to do business, and both Exxon and Chevron have pulled out of projects in the region recently.
Exxon recently reduced its stake in an Iraqi oil field as the Baghdad and Kurdish governments squabble over oil rights to multinational energy giants. While the West Qurna I field that Exxon scaled back boasts an impressive estimated 8 billion barrels of oil, Iraq's unstable political situation -- and now the rising tide of conflict in the region -- makes this a safe play by Exxon.
Chevron, on the heels of selling its Egyptian retail network, has pulled out of a Nigerian liquefied-natural-gas project after delays plagued the venture. Nigeria is an energy-rich state and nowhere near as unstable as Iraq or Syria, and Chevron is hardly quitting the country entirely: It's the third-largest energy-producer in the country. While the company has looked to sell off several assets in Nigeria, it's vital that Chevron continues to increase its presence in energy-rich Africa.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
After strong economic data was released this morning, the markets are moving higher across the board. As of 12:45 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is up by 62 points, or 0.42%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have gained 0.52% and 1.01%, respectively.
There were two economic reports today: The weekly jobless-claims number and revised second-quarter GDP. Jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 331,000 last week. A number in the low 300,000 range is what most economists consider normal churn of the labor market, so we shouldn't expect this number to fall much lower than where it is, but the fact that it's in that range means that the unemployment rate in the U.S. shouldn't rise because of Americans losing their jobs. 
The revised Q2 GDP number was a pleasant surprise for most investors. The previous estimate was 1.7%, but today the Department of Commerce said it actually came in at 2.5% for the three-month period. Analysts had been expecting a 2.2% revised number, so they were also well under the actual result. Although the figure is higher than expected, it will still be difficult for the economy to meet Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's GDP goal for the year, which is in the range of 2.3% to 2.6%. That would require the economy to grow at an annualized rate of 2.9% in both Q3 and Q4 -- which most economists don't see happening. 
Dow stocks losing out
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD
) is off by 0.4% today as fast-food protests have begun in a number of cities around the country. Employees have walked off the job to protest for higher hourly rates and the right to unionize. Currently, most fast-food workers receive the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, and they are asking for $15.00. Making $7.25 an hour and working a full work week would translate to about $15,000 per year, which many don't consider a living wage. Today's walkout will certainly get the attention of fast-food executives, but it's unknown at this time whether the major companies will give in, or whether they'll feel any financial impact.  
Both of the Dow's big oil components, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), are trading lower today. Shares of both companies were leading all Dow components just two days ago when we realized that U.S. intervention in the Syrian civil war was quite likely. Although Syria is not a major player in Middle Eastern oil-production, the threat of military action and increased conflict in the region sent the price of oil higher, and thus the shares of the oil companies followed suit. But now that it seems a strike by U.S. or allied forces would be a short-lived event, the price of oil is backing down, and so are the share prices of the major oil players. Chevron is down 0.5%, while Exxon has lost 1.3%.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is trying to make some headway this morning in order to gain back the losses from its previous two-day trading slump. Though it's only up 79 points as of 11:45 a.m. EDT, the index has some pretty good news to hang its hat on.
It's the economy... 
Investors got a pleasant surprise this morning when the revised GDP estimate for the second quarter was announced at 2.5% -- a solid increase from the previous estimate of 1.7%. With the upward revision comes renewed evidence that the economy is recovering, and this should give both investors and consumers a boost in confidence.
Weekly jobless claims numbers were also released this morning, with the latest count dropping 6,000 to 331,000 for last week -- another positive sign that businesses are maintaining their workforce. Investors will have to wait until next week's Employment Situation report from the Department of Labor to see whether or not those same businesses are hiring more workers, which is the activity the economy really needs to get it moving.
Fill 'er up 
Though the situation in Syria is no closer to being resolved than it was yesterday or the day before, consumers are getting a bit of good news this morning. Though Syria is not a major player in the oil market, any military activity in the Middle East is seen as a probable disruption to the outflow of oil. With that in mind, investors drove up shares of both Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), expecting higher gas prices as the Syrian issue developed. But this morning, both companies are down following the news that oil futures are indicating that any spike in oil prices will be short-lived -- as would higher gas prices. Without any knowledge of what type of military intervention and response will occur in Syria, all of the uncertainty is being priced into the first month. Should prolonged military action occur, prices would remain higher for longer.
Hold the phone 
The confirmation of talks between Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD
) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ
) over the former's sale of its 45% stake in their U.S. joint venture, Verizon Wireless, to the latter has sent both stocks soaring. Though there hasn't been a deal made yet, the estimated $130 billion sale would be the largest such deal ever made and would save Vodafone an estimated $35 billion in taxes.
