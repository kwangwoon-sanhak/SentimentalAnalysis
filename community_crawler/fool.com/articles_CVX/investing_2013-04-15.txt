Since acquiring Texaco in 2001, Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) has been embroiled in a legal battle related to Texaco's operations in Ecuador in the 1960s. The Fool discussed the background of the case, which revolves around environmental contamination due to an oil spill, in the article, "Exclusive Fool Interview: A Look at Both Sides of Chevron's Nightmare Legal Battle." To learn firsthand how this case has evolved and where it stands today, we conducted interviews with both parties to the case -- plaintiffs and defendants. The following interview took place on Feb. 12, 2013 with defendants from Chevron. 

There's a lot of red ink on Wall Street today after China took a bite out of the market's enthusiasm. The world's second-largest economy said GDP rose 7.7% in the first quarter, slowing from 7.9% in Q4 and falling short of economists' 8% estimate. Growth in China has helped drive global demand as the U.S. and Europe fight off economic struggles, so investors are more than a little concerned about the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) sold off 1.19% as a result of the news, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC
) is down 1.73% today.
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
) is taking the biggest hit on the Dow, crashing 3.1% today. The company relies on growth in emerging markets to grow sales, and China's GDP numbers will always affect the stock in the short term. A lot of this weakness is already priced into the stock, so it may not be bad for long-term investors. The company reports earnings next Monday, and estimates call for $1.44 per share in earnings, down from $2.37 a year ago.
If you thought stocks were getting hit hard today, you need to take a look at the commodities market. Gold is down 9.6% as I write, silver has fallen 12.9%, and oil is down 2.7% to less than $89 per barrel. This drop has hit oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), who are down 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively. You can see in the chart below that a drop in oil's price may impact earnings at both companies, but it'll have to be a lot more severe than $2 per barrel.

Economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe and a slowdown in China may lead to a drop in the price of oil, but it will only be temporary. Investors with a long-term view can pick up highly profitable companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron on these drops, because these supermajors can generate a strong profit no matter what oil does.

This morning, news that China's economic growth is slowing more than expected is raising a lot of concern on Wall Street. As of 12:45 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is down 164 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 has lost 1.38% and the NASDAQ is down 1.66%.
The report that China's GDP grew a mere 7.7% during the first three months of 2013, after it grew 7.9% during the last three months of 2012 and economists forecast growth of 8%, really has investors worried. Commodities across the board are falling, but gold is faring the worst, down more than $92, or 6.15%, at the time of writing.
A few stocks are being hurt by lower commodity prices. Both of the major oil and gas components of the Dow are also falling today. Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) is down 2.4%, while ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) has lost 2.2%. The price of a barrel of light crude oil has fallen 3.6% today, and unleaded gasoline per gallon is down 1.67%. The feared slowdown in China is likely the reason the price of oil is dropping. However, as we have seen in the past, the price of oil falls only briefly before moving higher again. Investors in Chevron or Exxon should ride out this temporary downturn and wait for higher prices at the pump.
Other stocks that are getting hammered by the Chinese report include Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
). Both companies need strong construction markets, which China had been for years. Now that it seems the go-go days are coming to an end, each company will be faced with finding a new emerging market in which to sell its products.
In Alcoa's 10-K, which reported the company's performance during 2012, management predicted aluminum demand growth of 11% in China during 2013. In Caterpillar's most recent 10-K, the company said a large sales decrease in China during 2012 more than offset the increases in Japan and the other countries within the Asia-Pacific market. Both Alcoa and Caterpillar need a strong China if they want to sustain revenue and profit.

Lately, the stock market has captured the lion's share of investors' attention, especially as it climbed to successive all-time record highs. But the crash of gold prices has taken on greater significance today, losing more than $100 per ounce today alone and adding to similar declines over the past couple of weeks. Moreover, as investor confidence is deflated by a report from China suggesting slower growth in the emerging-market country as well as a poor reading on sentiment among homebuilders, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) opened the week with losses that quickly widened to more than 100 points before recovering slightly. As of 10:45 a.m. EDT, the Dow is down about 70 points.
Among Dow stocks, the obvious victim of gold's decline is Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT
), which has dropped 2.7%. The maker of construction and mining equipment will suffer both from slowing growth in China, one of its primary markets, and from reduced mining activity among gold producers that will suddenly find their operations much less profitable than they were before the plunge in precious metals.
But weakness extended throughout the commodities-related Dow stocks. Oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) are both down more than 1.5% on fears that China's slowdown will cascade throughout the global economy, reducing overall levels of industrial activity and thereby removing key support for the relatively high oil prices that have persisted even through the sluggish economic recovery of the past several years. Meanwhile, Alcoa (NYSE:AA
) has dropped 1.5%, following its typical pattern of tracking China's economic health. Yet in the longer term, if a slowdown further weakens aluminum prices, then it could perhaps break the backs of Chinese aluminum producers that have contributed to the glut of supply on the market.
Outside the Dow, precious-metals investments, including bullion-linked ETFs and shares of gold- and silver-mining stocks, took the biggest hits. The key question investors in precious metals face is whether today's action represents panic-selling from which a longer-term recovery could build or the beginning of a long-term downtrend as the Fed considers potential interest-rate hikes that will increase the opportunity cost of owning gold. Investors need to consider both possibilities as they assess whether now is the right time to buy.
