Two of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (DJINDICES:^DJI
) biggest components have become two of the biggest laggards so far in 2013. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are dominant players in oil and have been great investments for a long time but this year they're being overshadowed by smaller renewable energy companies that are beginning to take share in the energy industry.
Recent earnings from ExxonMobil and Chevron show the challenges they're facing. Yesterday, ExxonMobil said revenue fell 2.4% in the third quarter and net income was down 21.6%, primarily on lower refining earnings. A similar trend played out today for Chevron, which reported that revenue was up just 0.8% to $58.5 billion and net income was down 5.8% to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share. As a result, Chevron is the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average today, falling 1.9%, and you can see that performance has been weak for both stocks this year.
In contrast, both First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR
) and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR
) have reported earnings in the past two days that have crushed everyone's expectations. First Solar earned $1.94 per share, demolishing the $1.18 estimate, and SunPower's $0.44 in earnings was well above the $0.29 estimate from Wall Street.
As renewable energy companies have grown and improved profits, their stocks have outperformed big oil by a wide margin, as you can see below.

Long term, the trends continue to be in the favor of renewable energy and against big oil. Solar projects in Chile, Hawaii, Germany, and elsewhere are competitive with the grid without subsidy, and costs are only coming down. New markets like Saudi Arabia, Africa, and China are just scratching the surface of their potential.
On the flip side, oil is becoming harder to find, forcing explorers to look in ultra-deepwater and shale deposits around the world. This increases the cost for oil, and as demand for gasoline has dropped in the U.S. and Europe there's become less appetite for passing those costs on through higher gas prices. Not only is big oil's top line not growing, it's getting pressure on the bottom line as well.
Big oil isn't going away overnight, but it may be time to start considering a little renewable energy exposure for your portfolio. Energy trends are certainly tilting in their favor.

The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) is up 32 points as of 11:30 EDT, though it had gained nearly 100 points prior to the release of the ISM Manufacturing Index and comments from Federal Reserve Governor Jim Bullard.
The ISM report indicated that manufacturing activity in the U.S. was better than economists had expected. Although that report appears positive for the U.S. economy, and therefore U.S. stocks, it may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve reduces its purchases of long-term asset, which have helped push the market to new highs. On Wednesday, the Fed said it would wait for more evidence before reducing its purchases -- a stronger ISM Manufacturing Index is additional evidence of an improving U.S. economy.
Meanwhile, Bullard declined to speculate on whether or not the Fed would curtail its asset purchases in December, instead saying only that the Fed needed to keep its options open.
Chevron posts poor earnings on well output
Dow-component Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) tumbled roughly 2% after the company posted earnings that disappointed analysts. In the third quarter, Chevron earned $2.57 per share, down from $2.69 in the prior year. Chevron cited weakness in its well-output business.
Chevron's report appears to be further evidence of an ongoing trend in its industry. On Thursday, Chevron's rival ExxonMobil reported earnings, and it, too, saw profit decrease -- in Exxon's case, 18%.
First Solar rockets higher on earnings beat
First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR
) meanwhile posted a huge gain on the session, rallying 16.5%. Like Chevron, First Solar reported earnings, but unlike Chevron its profit jumped. In the third quarter, First Solar reported earnings per share of $1.94, nearly double the $1 per share it reported in the same period last year.
In addition to reporting strong earnings, First Solar also raised its guidance, saying it would earn more this year than it had expected. And while First Solar's report was no doubt strong, the outsized gain in shares may have been partially due to First Solar's high short interest -- almost 17% of outstanding First Solar shares have been sold short.
J.C. Penney bounces back
Shares of department store J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) also moved sharply higher during the session, breaking above $7.80 after for a gain of more than 5%. It wasn't abundantly clear why J.C. Penney was strongly outperforming the market -- unlike Chevron and First Solar, the company did not report earnings.
Still, J.C. Penney has been an incredibly volatile stock in recent weeks, briefly falling to an all-time low in October after investors became concerned with J.C. Penney's ability to survive as a company. In such an extreme situation, wild swings are likely.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
After a strong October sent it up more than 400 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) continued that momentum into the new month, climbing about 70 points just before 11 a.m. EDT. The stock market often has a positive bias on the first day of the month as automatic investment plans kick in to add retail-investor money to the market. Among the biggest movers in the Dow are Visa (NYSE:V
), Boeing (NYSE:BA
), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
), with the oil giant holding the Dow back while Boeing and Visa post solid gains.
Chevron's decline of nearly 2% came after it released its third-quarter report this morning. Weaker margins from Chevron's refinery operations contributed to a nearly 6% drop in earnings from the year-ago quarter, but sales rose slightly as production of both oil and natural gas climbed during the quarter. Chevron's long-run prospects remain sound, as the company moves forward with major projects to bring liquefied natural gas from Australia to serve energy-hungry markets throughout Asia. Plans to tap the Gulf of Mexico's deepwater energy riches also represent a big growth driver for Chevron.
Visa has regained some of the ground it lost yesterday, climbing 1.7%. The card-network giant reported somewhat discouraging results, especially in light of rival MasterCard's (NYSE: MA) stronger performance during the most recent quarter. One big issue facing Visa is that its exposure to Europe is far smaller than MasterCard's. That helped Visa when Europe was falling into recession, but now that the continent's economy appears to be on the rebound, MasterCard is benefiting more from its recovery than Visa. If U.S. spending starts to pick up, though, Visa should get a disproportionate share of any resulting gains.
Boeing has climbed 1.6%, reflecting both optimism about today's economic data on manufacturing and the aircraft maker's decision yesterday to boost its long-term production rate for its 737 model program. As Boeing's order book has climbed substantially in 2013, the company's expansion plans are not only completely justified, but they're necessary for the company to execute on the high demand for its aircraft. So long as the airline industry remains healthy, investors can expect to see Boeing continue to get new orders to bolster overall growth.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) reported its third-quarter results this morning, with earnings falling 5.8% from year-ago levels to $4.95 billion. Yet the oil giant's revenue climbed by 0.8% to $58.5 billion, and rising production levels in both oil and natural gas helped ease concerns about Chevron's growth prospects.
Unlike rival ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
), which posted mixed results among its internal divisions, Chevron saw net income drop in both its upstream and downstream operations. Upstream earnings from Chevron's exploration and production businesses fell by almost 1%, with a sharp decline in income from the U.S. side of the segment more than offsetting slight gains internationally. But downstream operations from refining and marketing took a much bigger earnings hit, with net income from the segment dropping 45%. Foreign-currency effects also continued to hold Chevron's earnings down, as the company attributed $276 million in lost earnings to the strong dollar.
On the production side, though, Chevron posted solid gains. Total production rose by 2.7%, with growth coming equally from domestic and international projects. Natural gas production growth outpaced Chevron's overall production growth rate, although the 2.2% gain in oil and liquids production reversed drops earlier in the year on that side of the business.
Chevron CEO John Watson blamed the earnings drop on lower refinery margins but cited "good progress on our major capital projects," including its construction of liquefied-natural-gas plants in Australia and its deepwater efforts in the Gulf of Mexico, as reason for optimism. Watson also pointed to growth opportunities in Chevron's downstream business.
As of 9:10 a.m. EDT, Chevron shares were down about 0.5% in pre-market trading.
Chevron will have a conference call at 11 a.m. EDT to discuss the results in further detail. For more information, visit the Chevron investor relations site.
