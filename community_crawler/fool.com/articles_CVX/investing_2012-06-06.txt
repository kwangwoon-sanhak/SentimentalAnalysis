The following video is part of our "Motley Fool Conversations" series, in which Fool contributor and personal finance analyst Dan Caplinger discusses topics around the investing world.
Today, Dan looks at ExxonMobil in the latest installment of a Motley Fool series in which we examine how each Dow stock affects the world-renowned blue chip average. Even though Exxon has the biggest market cap of any Dow component, the way that the Dow Jones is calculated gives Exxon less weight than several other stocks in the Dow. Dan discusses whether this fairly reflects Exxon's influence and then speculates about whether more energy stocks might get added to the Dow in the future.
From Exxon on down, energy stocks present a huge potential for growth and profits. Let me invite you to read about one promising energy stock right here in The Motley Fool's special free report on the energy industry and its best prospects.

With the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDEX: ^DJI) having fallen more than 1,175 points in slightly over a month, the traditional battle lines were drawn between bearish investors looking for a crash and bottom-feeding value investors seeking bargains. Today, the bulls won the contest, with stocks soaring as investors started to see signs of plans falling into place to address Europe's financial crisis. The Dow finished up 287 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rose between 2% and 2.5%.
The best-performing stocks in the Dow, though, rose quite a bit more than that. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) was the big gainer on the day, rising more than 7%. If the Federal Reserve ends up working with other central banks to ease monetary policy yet again, then investors expect banks around the world to benefit from their continuing low-interest rate policies.
United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) gained almost 4% as the company continues to move toward completing its acquisition of Goodrich next month. A return to a stronger economy could bode especially well for companies tied to the defense industry, as improving economic growth might forestall planned government budget cutbacks by making them unnecessary.
Oil stocks also performed quite well, even though crude oil prices were up only about 1%. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) both climbed more than 3%, even as many smaller players in the industry posted even larger gains. Oil still has quite a long way to go to get back to its $100-plus prices from a few months back, but the growing belief that the economy won't plunge so far that it hampers energy demand is definitely supporting big oil stocks like Exxon and Chevron today.
