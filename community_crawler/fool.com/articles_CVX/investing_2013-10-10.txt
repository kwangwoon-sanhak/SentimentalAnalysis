The Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI
) posted their best session of 2013, as lawmakers presented the framework for what could become a way forward in negotiations on the federal budget. But despite a 323-point rise in the average that sent all 30 Dow components higher, oil stocks Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) were the weakest performers in the Dow, putting in much more modest advances.
After more than a week of fear and consternation about the federal government's inability to figure out how to reopen and resolve its short-term fiscal needs, investors were ready to celebrate even the merest hint of a possible break in the Washington stalemate. They got their excuse to celebrate today, as reports came out that the House of Representatives might agree to increase the debt ceiling modestly in order to buy time for more extended negotiations about spending. Although it's unclear whether such a deal would involve ending the government shutdown, investors didn't seem to care, leading the Dow to its biggest gain since late 2011. Broader markets posted similar gains of around 2%.
But despite a rise in oil prices to approach the $103 per barrel level, the largest oil stocks didn't really participate in the rally to its fullest extent. Chevron was the weakest of the group, rising just 0.2%, as the company issued a gloomy outlook last night in advance of its upcoming third-quarter earnings release. Chevron said its upstream results would likely rise from the second quarter, as international production gains outpaced declines in U.S. production levels. But downstream results from refining and marketing operations would take a bigger earnings hit, and foreign-exchange losses were likely to put further pressure on the company's results.
Exxon did somewhat better, climbing about 1%. Yet, investors are concerned that Exxon hasn't taken the steps that some of its peers have in restructuring its operations to take maximum advantage of changing market conditions. In particular, Exxon and Chevron haven't followed the industry trend of spinning off refinery operations and midstream assets into new investment vehicles. Exxon has been good about boosting dividends and buying back shares, but production declines are an even bigger threat for it than for Chevron.
Finally, outside the Dow, BP (NYSE:BP
) rose only 0.8% despite winning a jury trial over pollution-related injury allegations in Texas. Residents who lived near the company's Texas City refinery sued BP, claiming that it released toxic and carcinogenic chemicals into the air. But the jury ruled for BP, finding the oil company negligent, but rejecting claims that its negligence caused the injuries.

Although we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over daily movements, we do like to keep an eye on market changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis.
There's no slowing stocks today on the latest information bites out of Washington. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI
) exploded out of the starting gate this morning and hasn't looked back. The blue-chip index has soared more than 230 points, or a whopping 1.6%, as of 2:45 p.m. EDT. While the debt ceiling debate isn't something that should alter your investing strategy, a few big-name stocks are making waves today, led by UnitedHealth's (NYSE:UNH
) solid gains. Let's catch up on what you need to know.
UnitedHealth hits the gas
UnitedHealth's stock has jumped 3% today to lead the Dow higher. There's little news out of the company, which is understandably in a period of change as Obamacare is rolled out across the country. While health care reform's been a sticky subject so far, UnitedHealth hasn't suffered for it: The stock's one of the best-performing Dow members year to date, with shares jumping more than 33% so far in 2013.
Much of UnitedHealth's success is due to the company's ability to expand its industry-leading membership base. The company is America's largest public insurer, and UnitedHealth hasn't let off the gas pedal in 2013. UnitedHealth counted 45 million total medical subscribers at the end of June, a 25% year-over-year gain. That's outstanding growth for an organization of this size and will help it hedge against any unwanted side effects of health-care reform, such as higher costs in state exchanges -- a factor that helped push UnitedHealth to opt out of participating in numerous individual insurance exchanges in states including California.
However, investors shouldn't expect such rapid growth every year. Part of the big gains in 2013 come from the integration of the U.S. military's TRICARE insurance system into UnitedHealth's portfolio, a move that added nearly 3 million subscribers. The company also made some smart moves abroad that should help growth in the future, with its purchase of Brazilian insurer Amil last year standing out. With the insurance industry in flux as Obamacare launches, UnitedHealth is one of the safest and strongest stocks in the industry.
Big Oil's not having such a good day today, however. As the Dow rises, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) are among the worst performers on the index, with the former gaining just 0.2% while the latter has lost 0.5%. Chevron announced today that third-quarter earnings would fall significantly below its second-quarter results due to lower fuel margins in its refining business. The company also said in its interim quarterly update that U.S. net oil-equivalent production is down from the second quarter.
Exxon's been taking a blow from low natural-gas prices, a factor that crippled the company's second-quarter earnings. However, Exxon also sees natural-gas demand skyrocketing in coming years -- and the sheer economies of scale could be enough to help outweigh recessed margins and please investors. In the long run, Exxon and Chevron remain two of the biggest giants in the energy sector and two of the best-placed businesses to capitalize on America's resurgent energy boom.

Come next week, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS
) will stop printing stock certificates. The paper certificates, which have been serious collectors' items for decades, will give way to exclusively electronic records on October 16.
The certificate is famous for a reason. Walt Disney's portrait, surrounded by some of the company's most loved characters, adorns the proof of your stock ownership. The document is a popular way to introduce young'uns to investing, as it marries a serious financial document with kid-friendly and high-quality artwork, not to mention the brand name itself.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC
) dropped its paper documents way back in 2005. The semiconductor giant would probably have gone paperless earlier if it could: The state of Delaware, where Intel and a plethora of other major businesses are incorporated, had just lifted its paper certificate requirements when Intel took the plunge. The company handled 4,000 paper certificate requests to record market transactions in the first half of 2005 -- a costly hassle that electronic management all but eliminates.But we're moving one step closer to the paperless office -- and investment portfolio -- with Disney's announcement. And the House of Mouse isn't even breaking particularly new ground. Many Dow (DJINDICES:^DJI
) tickers separated from their paper certificates years ago.
Oil titan Chevron (NYSE:CVX
) also removed its paper option in 2005. If you're still holding a printed Chevron certificate eight years later, you'll need to convert it into electronic form before selling the darn thing. That's rarely a thesis-changing investing problem, but Chevron is an old soul with roots stretching back to Standard Oil. Longtime investors need to know about this newfangled electronic model.
I imagine Disney will see an unusually large number of shares taken out of circulation because owners like to have the docs framed on their children's walls for nostalgic value rather than the cold, hard cash.
Designing and printing the documents is not free, and do you really want your online broker to hoard paper documents in a bank vault somewhere? Paperless certificates are the way of the future, even when the change tugs on your heartstrings.
Bottom line, this trend is all about more efficient markets. The cost savings involved are minimal next to the billion-dollar budgets of Disney or Intel. But the back-end efficiencies of going all digital can make a difference to the stock's market availability. In this age of high-speed transactions and robo-traders, that's enough to ditch even a certificate with marketing chops, like Disney's.
Japan's markets went all digital in 2009, expecting to save more than 100 billion yen a year on the reduced paper shuffling. That works out to $1 billion annually for a market with less than 1% of the NYSE's average dollar volume. Overall, the trend toward more electronic stock management should shorten settlement cycles and reduce the risk of losing or destroying physical documents. These are all good things for the trading industry and the invididual investor.
