For the better part of two years now, investors have reaped the benefits of the declining U.S. dollar. It may seem counterintuitive, but the market and the dollar have a tendency to run inversely proportional to each other -- so when currency goes down, stocks usually go up.
Think about it this way: It takes more bills to equal the value of a product when the dollar is weak than when it's strong. Commodities have in particular seen a boost from the trend, for when faith in paper currency is lost, tangible items suddenly seem all the more precious.
Back when the bottom dropped out of the market, the Fed instated a Quantitative Easing program to print and pump money into the economy, and it's been going on ever since. This constant influx of paper has kept the dollar down and commodities high.
So what's the problem then? Well, that this simply can't go on forever. Many experts think that the dollar is nearing its point of inflection. As the price of in-demand commodities like oil and corn skyrocket, consumers will start to feel it at the gas pump and the supermarket -- and when the cost of living increases, spending decreases. At some point, the dollar must rise again.
And when that happens, commodities will probably take a hit.
