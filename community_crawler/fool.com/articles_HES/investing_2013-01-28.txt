Hess (NYSE:HES) closed the final chapter of its refining arm after announcing the closing of its Port Reading Refinery in addition to putting 11 U.S. oil storage terminals up for sale. By exiting the refining business, Hess expects to free up around $1 billion of working capital, which can be better deployed in its prolific E&P arm. With the cost saving expected from shedding its oil storage terminals in addition to divesting billions of dollars in assets in 2012, Hess looks rejuvenated to outperform its peers. Check out the video below for more information on the deal and more insight into Hess' diversified asset base.

All good things must come to an end, and the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) eight-day winning streak is now history. Mixed economic data and mild profit taking were enough to push the broader market index modestly lower for the day.
Pending homes sales took the wind out of the market's sails early this morning with a 4.3% month-over-month decline in December. Pending sales are still nearly 7% higher than last year, but a sudden lack of inventory on the market appears to be sacking near-term hopes for building material suppliers such as Weyerhaeuser (NYSE:WY), which finished the day down nearly 3%. Homebuilders are going to be particularly cautious about ramping up production and overextending themselves as they did last decade. This means Weyerhaeuser and its peers' profit estimates could wind up being a bit overoptimistic. For the day, the S&P 500 ended lower by 2.78 points (-0.18%) to close at 1,500.18.
Even with the modest downdraft, three companies, in particular, found plenty of room to charge higher.
The day's big winner was Hess (NYSE:HES), which announced its intention to sell its storage terminal network and exit the refining business completely. It's estimated that the sale of Hess' storage facilities, located on the East Coast, could free up around $1 billion in capital and will leave the company as a pure oil and gas exploration play. The move makes a lot of sense given that refining margins are often lower than E&P margins and the company's liquid assets in the Bakken region look promising. Shares of Hess advanced 6% on the news.
Printing service and information technology specialist Xerox (NYSE:XRX) crept its way into the plus column, rising 4%, following an upgrade from BMO Capital Markets to "outperform" from "market perform." The covering analyst, Keith Bachman, noted improving operating margins and cited the chance that a diverse capital allocation could lead to a positive 2013. As usual, I often advise against paying too much credence to analyst upgrades and downgrades, but this is one I wholeheartedly agree with. Just last week, I made my case for why Xerox could be a big turnaround candidate in 2013, especially with its move into handling Medicaid payments in the state of California. I'll be looking for continued momentum higher from Xerox.
Finally, biotechnology company Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB) rose just shy of 3% after its fourth-quarter earnings results and 2013 guidance impressed Wall Street. For the quarter, revenue rose 7% to $1.42 billion, although EPS came up $0.06 shy primarily because of a $0.12 tax charge incurred from an error in previous returns. Sales expectations next year call for 10% growth with EPS in the range of $7.15-$7.25. Wall Street had expected sales growth of about 9% and EPS of $7.27. The bigger news was the expected launch of BG-12, Biogen's potential blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug that's set to launch in March. According to ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenbaum, Biogen's indirect sales estimate for BG-12 is $350 million to $450 million this year. That'd be a fantastic start for BG-12 and would certainly support Biogen's already pricey valuation.

In a press release issued today, Hess (NYSE:HES) announced plans to sell its 19-terminal network along the East Coast, as well as close Hess' last refinery, located in Port Reading, N.J.
The terminal network was used primarily as an outlet for its HOVENSA refinery. However, after Hess closed down the HOVENSA partnership last year, it was determined the U.S. terminal network, with its storage capacity of 28 million barrels, is no longer necessary. The company's Caribbean terminal, with a storage capacity of 10 million barrels, will also be included in the sale. A projected price tag for the terminal network was not announced in the press release.
After incurring losses two of the past three years, Hess also announced it is shutting down its Port Reading, N.J., refinery, which manufactures gas and components for heating oil. The refinery will be closed by the end of February.
Sale of the terminal network is expected to free up $1 billion in capital. According to CEO John Hess, "By closing the Port Reading refinery and selling our terminal network, Hess will complete its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to one that is predominantly an exploration and production company and be able to redeploy substantial additional capital to fund its future growth opportunities."
