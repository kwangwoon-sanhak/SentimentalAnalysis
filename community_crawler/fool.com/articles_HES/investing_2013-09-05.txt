Summer is best known as a time when the kids are out of school, families are taking vacations, temperatures are soaring, and prices at the pump shoot sky high. Apparently, summer is also a time for a select group of companies to unleash some gigantic dividend increases.
In early June, I took a look at seven brand-name companies that, since the beginning of the year, had at least doubled their dividend. Just since summer began, we've tacked on an additional five companies that have matched this feat -- and summer isn't even over yet for another two-plus weeks!
