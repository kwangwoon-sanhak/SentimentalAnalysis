NEW YORK (AP) -- Hess (NYSE:HES) expects to resume production by the end of the week at its Port Reading, N.J., refinery, which has been closed since Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast.
The process to restart the refinery began a little more than two weeks after it was shut down as a precaution ahead of the massive storm, the company said Wednesday in an emailed statement.
Hess has resumed normal operations at its Port Reading terminal, where gas is pumped into tanker trucks for delivery to service stations.
The Hess terminal at Bayonne, N.J., has resumed limited operations using barges and tankers, but deliveries to tanker trucks still are suspended.
Hess shares fell 19 cents to $49.77 in afternoon trading. In the past 52 weeks, the stock has ranged from $39.67 to $67.86 per share.
