Hess (NYSE:HES) is keeping its dividend flowing at the same rate it has for quite some time. The company declared a quarterly distribution of $0.10 per share, which will be paid on June 28 to shareholders of record as of June 17.That amount is in line with every one of the firm's preceding regular payouts stretching back to June 2006. If a 3-for-1 stock split is taken into account, that history reaches back even further, to the beginning of 2001.
The current dividend annualizes to $0.40 per share. That yields just under 0.6% at Hess' most recent closing stock price of $66.76.
