2021 hasn't started on quite the same note that 2020 ended on, with major stock market benchmarks having seen some turbulence to begin the year. Yet on Tuesday, the market bounced back somewhat. Once today's runoff election in Georgia comes to a close, investors can look forward to some pieces of the geopolitical puzzle coming together.
pleased at the idea of having at least some pieces of the geopolitical puzzle set to come together once today's runoff election in Georgia comes to a close. A volatile trading session sent stocks lower briefly this morning, but by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI), S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) were all nicely higher.

Yet those gains paled in comparison to what energy stocks enjoyed on Tuesday. Much of that came from a big bullish move in the crude oil market. With many investors worried that the stock market has come so far in just nine months despite huge economic uncertainty, the search for the next leader for the bull market has led some to hope that oil and gas might step up to the plate.
The good news in energy started in the crude oil  pits. West Texas Intermediate closed up more than $2 per barrel, briefly moving above the $50 mark before finishing just a few cents short. Brent crude, which is favored on international markets, had a nearly $3 move higher to finish above $53.50 per barrel.
The news that prompted the push higher in the oil markets came from Saudi Arabia. The largest producing member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pledged to reduce its oil production volume in an effort to stabilize prices. The move was somewhat surprising, but it succeeded in generating a freeze in overall output levels when you include major non-OPEC member Russia.
Russia and Saudi Arabia have had significant tensions for nearly a year now. When the COVID-19 pandemic crushed oil demand, the two countries couldn't agree on an appropriate response. At the time, Saudi Arabia chose simply to keep its production at relatively high levels, ensuring cash flow but allowing prices to plunge. Now, the Saudis are apparently reversing that policy.
Oil stocks did well in response. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares were up nearly 5%, while BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) climbed 7%. In oilfield services, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted an 8% rise. Midstream pipeline operators like ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) and Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) also had gains of 5% or more. Refiners settled for smaller gains.
In terms of the stock market, energy has largely lost its importance. The sector makes up only a few percentage points of the S&P 500, so even big gains won't lift index funds.
However, economically, the impact of strong energy prices is significant. Oil-producing areas depend on higher prices, and the ripple effect supports businesses of all kinds. With the COVID-19 pandemic having crushed many small and mid-sized businesses in locations where oil and natural gas are typically found, a recovery in energy prices would be welcome news.
Plenty of catalysts could lead the stock market higher in 2021. Energy stocks have struggled for so long that if they were to recover fully, it would be enough of a milestone perhaps to signal a new leg for an impressive bull market.

Shares of all the major oil stocks are rocketing in afternoon trading Tuesday on news that Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation have reached a compromise on oil production levels.
In 1:30 p.m. EST trading, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) stock is up 7.5%, followed by ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) with a 6.8% gain, and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is up 5.2%.

In December, OPEC and a group of oil-producing nations led by Russia agreed to permit an increase in production of 500,000 barrels per day, relenting on oil cutbacks instituted earlier in the pandemic that reduced production by first 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd), then only 7.7 million bpd. But as The Wall Street Journal just reported, the Saudis and Russians have agreed that January oil production levels (7.2 million bpd) will continue through February unchanged.  
No increase in output is now expected before March at the earliest.
Economics 101 teaches us that, given constant demand, limiting supply will push prices of any commodity up, and this is exactly what we're seeing today. OilPrice.com shows Brent crude prices up 5% at nearly $54 a barrel and WTI crude up 5.2% -- and now above the $50-a-barrel mark.  
Both of these developments are obviously good news for companies that sell oil -- companies like Exxon, Conoco, and Chevron. Investors should be aware, however, that the reprieve may be temporary.
As vaccines roll out and economies improve, demand for oil will likely grow, encouraging oil producers to sell more of it as they battle for market share. And despite the decision not to increase production in February, plans remain in place "to restore a total of 2 million barrels a day of output in the coming months," reports the Journal.
Today's news gives energy investors hope that the expanded group of oil-producing nations known as OPEC Plus can work together to establish reasonable production levels that will both secure supply and keep prices high enough to ensure reasonable profits. It doesn't mean, however, that they will continue to do so in future months.

Shares of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) plunged 40.9% in 2020, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. While a roughly 20% decline in oil prices played a role in Exxon's slump, it wasn't the only factor.  
The COVID-19 outbreak upended the oil market in 2020. It caused demand to fall off a cliff, which forced oil companies like Exxon to shift gears. Exxon initially responded by reducing its 2020 capital spending program by 30% and operating expenses by 15%.

While those moves helped reduce the bleeding, the company significantly outspent its cash flow in 2020, partly because it maintained its massive dividend. As a result, its debt ballooned from $47.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019 to $68.8 billion by the third quarter of 2020, putting pressure on its stock price.  
Meanwhile, persistently low oil prices caused Exxon to lose billions of dollars in 2020. Through the third quarter, the oil giant posted more than $2.3 billion in losses. But that pales compared to what the company anticipates for the fourth quarter, as it warned it would record a massive writedown of up to $20 billion in assets.  
Exxon also changed its long-term strategy in 2020. It plans to prioritize high-value assets, which will result in it investing only $16 billion to $19 billion in capital projects in 2021 while spending an annual average of $20 billion to $25 billion through 2025. That's a roughly $10 billion yearly reduction from its initial long-term forecast. As a result, it won't grow its production and earnings as much as it initially envisioned.  
Crashing crude oil prices in 2020 threw a wrench into ExxonMobil's long-term plan. The company had to slash spending so that it didn't pile on too much more debt, but it still significantly outspent cash flow to maintain its dividend.
Unless oil prices improve, the company will likely tack on more debt this year, putting its dividend at even more risk of a reduction. Because of that, Exxon's stock might not bounce back in 2021.
