Volatility has returned to the oil markets. After five straight days of gains, crude prices fell sharply Wednesday morning, breaking the longest winning streak of 2020.
U.S. benchmark WTI Crude hit a low of just over $12/barrel on April 28. Over the next five trading days, it soared more than 50% to reach an intraday high of nearly $26.50/barrel on Tuesday. The rally -- the longest since July 2019 -- reflected investor optimism that reopening global economies would drive fuel demand.
Wednesday morning, though, concerns about oversupply and lack of storage sent prices downward again to less than $23/barrel. The losses stopped when data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed a smaller-than-expected build in crude inventories over the past week.

Global benchmark Brent Crude, which is currently trading at higher prices than WTI Crude, experienced the same pattern: it closed at $22.74/barrel on April 28, and hit an intraday high of more than $32/barrel on May 5, before tumbling to $29/barrel Wednesday morning. 
The rally was stopped in its tracks by a Tuesday afternoon report from the American Petroleum Institute (API), which estimated a crude oil inventory build of 8.4 million barrels for the week ending May 1. Prices continued falling until the EIA's data, released Wednesday morning, estimated a much lower build of just 4.6 million barrels, which stopped the losses. 
Both numbers were lower than the prior week's build, which the EIA estimated at 9.0 million barrels and the API estimated at 10.0 million barrels, but oversupply remains a concern.
The falling oil prices dragged down oil stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Shares of the two oil giants were down about 1.5% in morning trading.

In recent years, it's become difficult to find high-quality stocks with dividend yields of 5% or more. Simply put, the 10-year bull market had driven the valuations of good companies higher, and yield and price have an inverse relationship.
While the COVID-19 pandemic is a terrible situation for the U.S. and its economy, it has created some opportunities for long-term investors, especially those who want dividend-paying stocks. With that in mind, here's why yield-seekers should take a closer look at Realty Income (NYSE:O), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

I've called net-lease real estate investment trust Realty Income the best all-around dividend stock in the market, and the company's first-quarter earnings report illustrates why. The company, which owns primarily single-tenant retail real estate, reported 7.3% year-over-year growth in funds from operations (the REIT version of earnings) and continues to make new investments to grow the portfolio.
Here's the most impressive part: While many of its peers in the retail real estate space are struggling, Realty Income is doing relatively well. Eighty-three percent of its tenants paid April rent, and occupancy stands at 98.5%. Of the 17% of April rent that hasn't yet been collected, most tenants are in rent deferral discussions with the company. And Realty Income has more than $2 billion in cash and credit availability, so it should be well-positioned to absorb any short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Realty Income has increased its dividend for 90 consecutive quarters (including in March 2020) and has delivered an annualized total return of 14.6% since its 1994 NYSE listing. With a 5.3% yield and the stock still 38% lower than its February high, Realty Income could be a fantastic addition to any dividend investor's portfolio.
Many investors are hesitant to invest in any oil stocks, and it's easy to understand why. After watching oil futures actually turn negative for a brief time in April and with the price of oil still at levels that make it unprofitable to produce for most American companies, many people are simply in "wait and see" mode.
However, this could be an excellent time to add a high-quality oil stock like ExxonMobil to your portfolio, especially if you have a long investing time frame. For one thing, Exxon is a massive and diversified business, with operations in refining, pipelines, chemical manufacturing, and more. While things like drilling are suffering, other parts of the business (such as refining) actually benefit from lower prices. And the company has cut capital spending and operating expenses dramatically to help cushion the blow of falling oil prices.
With a 7.6% yield (management has said the dividend will be maintained) and a stock price that's more than 40% off its 52-week high, ExxonMobil is a top-notch oil company that looks like a compelling long-term bargain.
The financial sector has been one of the worst-performing parts of the stock market in the COVID-19 pandemic, and Wells Fargo has been hit harder than most. Not only has Wells Fargo dramatically underperformed its big bank stock peers in recent years due to its numerous scandals and penalties, but it has lost nearly half of its value in 2020 alone.
There's a good reason for the recent underperformance. While most other big banks have investment banking divisions that do well in volatile environments, Wells Fargo is purely a commercial bank. The vast majority of its business comes from providing everyday banking services to individuals and businesses. And commercial banking has a lot of question marks right now -- if the pandemic causes a deep recession, Americans could have trouble paying their bills and loan defaults could spike. Plus, with record-low interest rates, it's not exactly an ideal environment for banks to profit.
However, Wells Fargo is a well-capitalized institution with generally strong asset quality. The stock trades for 31% less than book value and yields about 7.5%. With a new CEO at the helm and such a massive discount, Wells Fargo could be the best long-term value in the banking industry.
As a final point, while I think these will be stable dividend investments from a long-term perspective, it's important to keep in mind that the coronavirus outbreak is still far from over, and it is an unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation. If we get some bad virus-related news, or if it looks like the economic shutdown will have more of an impact than expected, these could certainly fall further in the near term. In a nutshell, buy these for their potential five, 10, or 20 years from now -- but expect a roller-coaster ride for the time being.

The past 10 weeks have been unlike anything Wall Street and retail investors have ever witnessed. The proliferation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the U.S. and around the globe has led to record levels of volatility in the stock market and neck-breaking moves up and down in the major U.S. indexes. In fact, we saw the benchmark S&P 500 push into bear market territory at a quicker pace than in any previous correction in history.
However, major downdrafts in the stock market have always proved to be advantageous opportunities to put your capital to work. That's because all corrections and bear markets are eventually put into the rearview mirror by bull market rallies. As long as you buy great companies and give your investment theses in these businesses ample time to be proved true, you have a very good chance of growing your wealth.
The thing is, you don't need to be a millionaire to make money in the stock market. If you have even $2,000 set aside that you won't need to pay bills or for emergencies, then the following three stocks could be the smartest buys you'll make.

Pretty much all companies in the financial sector are cyclical, which means they're going to feel some sort of pinch from the likely recession we've been pushed into by COVID-19. Credit-services giant Visa (NYSE:V) is no different, as it'll see the dollar amount transacted on its network decline as a greater number of Americans are laid off.
However, Visa has shown time and again that it's built to survive what are often relatively short downward moves in the stock market and U.S. economy. This is a company that currently holds more than half of all U.S. credit card market share by network purchase volume, which is an enviable position to be in considering that 70% of U.S. GDP is based on consumption. With the understanding that the U.S. economy spends far more time expanding than contracting, Visa should come out of this pandemic just fine.
What's more, Visa focuses solely on the processing side of the equation. Because it's not a direct lender, Visa isn't hurt by rising loan delinquencies that typically accompany and follow a recession. This allows Visa to rebound much faster than most of its credit-service peers and ensures that its profit margin, which is above 52% over the trailing-12-month period, remains superior.

Even though I'm an ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shareholder, I'll admit it's far from a sexy pick. We've witnessed a disruption to the oil market like never before, and it's going to be some time before supply and demand are brought back into some form of harmony. This makes profitability virtually impossible in the near term for most oil stocks.
Yet over the longer run, ExxonMobil is well-positioned to thrive. Remember that this is an integrated oil giant that's not solely dependent on drilling and exploration. Don't get me wrong, drilling is what offers the company its greatest growth prospects. Nothing would please me more than seeing the Payara Project and its up to 220,000 barrels per day of production get off the ground before mid-decade. But this is a company with plenty of cash flow potential from its downstream operations, such as refining and petrochemical operations. ExxonMobil is expected to lean on its downstream segment, which should benefit from weaker crude prices, for the foreseeable future. 
Exxon also has the luxury of cutting back on capital expenditures to control cash outflows during a period of unprecedented demand weakness. Recently, the company cut $10 billion off of its capital expenditure forecast for 2020 of $30 billion to $33 billion. The plan is to keep its dividend intact for now, but the company can save cash big time if it ever needs to dial back its payout.
In other words, ExxonMobil is going to be just fine.

Investors with $2,000 in spare cash would also be smart to load up on shares of pharma company Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Its shares have outperformed the broad-based S&P 500 in 2020, albeit they were still down more than 6%, year to date, through this past weekend.
While there are obvious concerns that clinical research could be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare stocks remain one of the most defensive categories throughout this mess. Because people don't get the luxury of choosing when they get sick or what ailment(s) they develop, demand for pharmaceuticals tends to remain consistent from one month to the next. This leads to predictable cash flow for Bristol Myers at a time when very little seems predictable.
Perhaps the biggest tailwind for the company is the recently completed acquisition of Celgene. Revlimid, Celgene's blockbuster multiple myeloma drug, may have a shot at $12 billion-plus in annual sales in 2020, and it will have its revenue stream protected from a flood of generic competition until the end of January 2026. That's a lot of cash flow headed Bristol Myers' way.
Furthermore, the company's cancer immunotherapy, Opdivo, is being tested in dozens of clinical trials, primarily as a combination therapy. We're talking about a drug that's already generating more than $7 billion annually in sales that could easily move past the $10 billion per year mark if it continues to expand its label.
At only 8 times next year's forecast profit, Bristol Myers Squibb looks like a screaming buy.
