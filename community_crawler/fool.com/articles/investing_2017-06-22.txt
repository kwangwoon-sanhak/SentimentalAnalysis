Eni S.p.A. (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.5% dividend yield, Royal Dutch Shell plc's (NYSE:RDS.B) yield is 6.5%, BP plc (NYSE:BP) is up at 6.8%, and Total SA (NYSE:TOT) sports 6.6%. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), meanwhile, has a yield of slightly over 4%, leaving ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) as the lowest-yielding oil major at around 3.7%. If all you care about is yield, go for international oil major Eni. But if you want more than that, only Exxon has proved that it will reward investors through thick and thin.
You could spend a lot of time comparing the oil giants' operations. And there are important nuances to each name. For example, Eni has some huge opportunities to expand production within its portfolio. Total has been fairly aggressively growing an electricity business to diversify its portfolio. Royal Dutch Shell made an opportunistic, and debt-fueled, acquisition to expand its business in the oil downturn that it's now integrating. BP finally looks as if it might be putting the massive Gulf of Mexico oil disaster in the rearview mirror. And ExxonMobil has historically been at or near the top of its peer group in return on capital employed.

Meanwhile, all of the oil majors have been doing roughly similar things to deal with the drop in oil prices that started in mid-2014. That's included trimming capital budgets, streamlining operations, and selling non-core assets to protect the top and bottom lines. For example, Chevron has reduced its exploration spending by roughly 50% since 2014 and lowered its operating and sales, general, and administrative costs by around 25%.  
These are all important facts that you need to know. But if you're a dividend investor, there's something else you should keep an eye on: dividend growth.
If you're like me, you prize dividend consistency. That means focusing on companies that have long and impressive records of supporting their dividends through thick and thin. Better yet are companies that regularly increase their dividends year in and year out. If you use dividend growth as part of your screening filter, you'll find that only one oil major stands up to the test.
BP, for example, was forced to restructure its business and cut its dividend after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. And while the dividend has been growing again lately, it hasn't been a steady climb. Mix the two together, and I'm happy elsewhere.  
Eni, despite a massive yield, fails the dividend test, too. That's because it trimmed its distribution by nearly 30% in 2015, almost as soon as the oil-price decline started to hit home. That doesn't inspire confidence that the dividend is sustainable, even after a cut. No, thanks.
Shell hasn't increased its dividend since 2014 and is now focused on paying down debt related to its big BG Group acquisition. It's also been using a scrip dividend to help preserve cash. I like Shell's opportunistic move using the downturn to expand its business, and I don't believe the dividend is in danger of being cut. But a stagnant dividend makes me pause even if I like the broader story.
Total's dividend has stayed the same or grown for 30 years. Not surprisingly, 2014 and 2015 was a two-year period in which the dividend didn't grow. It's nice that Total didn't cut its dividend, as Eni did, and that the dividend has started to grow again -- albeit by a single euro in 2016. So I wouldn't dismiss Total as an option. But there are better choices if you prefer to get annual "pay raises."

Chevron has increased its dividend annually for 29 years. That's a record I like, but it's not a clean fact. It's a byproduct of the company's increasing its dividend in the middle of the calendar year. For example, it held the dividend steady for 10 quarters between 2014 and 2016. That's two and half years with no increase even though the annual streak remained alive. Not exactly what I'm looking for.  
And then there's ExxonMobil. Exxon has a 35-year history of increasing its dividend. That includes an actual dividend increase every year through the deep oil downturn. Although Exxon has the lowest yield of the oil majors, it also has the most impressive dividend history. It's the best dividend option in my book.  
I'm not suggesting that annual dividend growth is the only factor you should look at. As I mentioned, there are subtle and large differences between all of the oil majors. But if dividend consistency is important to you, then you need to keep this fact high up on your checklist. Basically, of all the oil majors, Exxon alone has proved that it returns value to investors through dividend increases year in and year out. Sure, the yield is relatively low, but that's a trade-off you might be willing to accept to ensure your dividend checks keep coming and growing.

On the one hand, oil and gas producer Apache (NASDAQ:APA) is a decent dividend stock. At its current market price and payout rate, the company sports a 2.05% dividend yield. While not eye-catching, it is above average since it edges out the 1.89% yield for the S&P 500.
That said, the company's yield likely isn't high enough to entice most income investors, especially considering the higher risks associated with the oil and gas industry. That's why dividend investors should forget about Apache and focus on some better options. Three that stand out are ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).

ExxonMobil is a Dividend Aristocrat, which makes it royalty among income stocks. Overall, the oil behemoth has increased its payout for 35 straight years whereas Apache's dividend hasn't risen since 2013 and isn't likely to go up this year, either. Furthermore, ExxonMobil currently yields an enticing 3.7%, which is almost twice the market's average and well above Apache's. More importantly, the company can fully support its payout despite lower oil prices. Last quarter, for example, ExxonMobil generated $8.2 billion in cash flow from operations, which covered not only its $3.1 billion in dividends to shareholders but its $4.2 billion in capital expenditures with room to spare.
While the company did struggle to cover both capex and the dividend in 2016 due to crashing oil prices, it still generated $22.1 billion in cash flow, which satisfied its $12.5 billion dividend outlay and some of its $19.3 billion in capital expenditures. One of the drivers of Exxon's ability to generate so much cash flow in a down year is its integrated business model that includes both refineries and chemical plants, which are assets Apache doesn't operate. Those operations generated $8.8 billion of earnings last year for the company, helping offset cash flow lost to lower oil prices. ExxonMobil also has one of the highest credit ratings in the world, backed by low debt to capital of 18%, which is much stronger than Apache's 47% level. Because of those factors, ExxonMobil has the flexibility to continue financing growth and shareholder returns during periods of market weakness, making it a great dividend stock for the long term.
Chevron is also an oil behemoth, though, at a $200 billion market cap, it's quite a bit smaller than the $350 billion gorilla that is ExxonMobil. In addition, while Chevron also qualifies as a Dividend Aristocrat, its payout growth streak is slightly less at 29 years. That said, it does currently boast a higher yield at 4%, which is almost double what Apache pays. 
While the company did fall short in covering its payout with cash flow from operations last year, that trend has reversed in 2017 due to cost reductions and higher oil prices. Last year's outspend would have also been worse if it weren't for Chevron's downstream refining and chemicals business. Those assets generated $3.4 billion in earnings last year, which helped offset the $2.5 billion loss the company recorded in its upstream segment. That diversification, when combined with the strong balance sheet -- as evidenced by its 20% debt-to-capital ratio -- has been a key factor in Chevron's ability to pay a growing dividend for nearly three decades.

Occidental Petroleum, at 5%, currently boasts the highest yield in this group. While it doesn't quite have the storied dividend past of Exxon and Chevron, it's still a dividend champion in the energy sector since it has increased the payout for 14 consecutive years. These increases have been robust as well, as the company has delivered a more than 500% increase in the payout since 2002.
Aside from growing oil output, another reason Occidental Petroleum has been able to boost its payout over the years is that it owns several countercyclical assets that generate more cash flow when oil and gas prices decline. While the company doesn't own any refining assets, it does own several chemical plants, including the recently completed Ingleside Ethane plant, which it jointly owns with Mexichem. Add in the fact that Occidental Petroleum has a cash-rich balance sheet with low leverage of just 27% debt to capital, it has the capacity to maintain its dividend over the long term even if crude oil averages $40 per barrel.
While Apache pays a better-than-average dividend, it hasn't increased it in years. Furthermore, its lack of owning countercyclical chemical or refining assets, along with higher leverage, keeps its payout level well below those of rivals ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. That's why income investors should cross Apache off their list of potentials and focus on those other three oil stocks instead because they are better income options to own for the long term.

International oil major Eni SpA (NYSE:E) has a huge 8.4% dividend yield, more than double ExxonMobil Corporation's (NYSE:XOM) 3.7% yield. But that fat yield doesn't make Eni the better dividend stock. To be fair, there are reasons to like Eni beyond the dividend yield, including the huge opportunities presented by its Zohr project in Egypt and its Mozambique natural gas fields. But despite some positives, here are three reasons why ExxonMobil is a better choice for dividend investors than higher yielding Eni.   
At the end of the first quarter long-term debt made up 28% of Eni's capital structure. That's not an unreasonable level of debt by any means. However, Eni's core business is selling a commodity subject to often large and sudden price swings. Which is exactly what happened in mid-2014 when oil fell from over $100 a barrel to the $30 a barrel area at the worst of the decline. Oil prices have moved higher since that point, hovering in the $40 to $50 per barrel range lately, but it's still well off its highs.

Exxon's long-term debt makes up just 12% of its capital structure. That gives the oil giant a material amount of flexibility that Eni just doesn't have. In fact, Exxon has made extensive use of its balance sheet strength during the downturn to support its business and dividend.  At the start of 2014, long-term debt was roughly 5% of the capital structure. Eni's long-term debt, for comparison, was around 26% of its capital structure at the start of 2014...  
Clearly Eni didn't have the same capacity to support its business with debt, and still doesn't. Which helps explain why Eni sold a stake in its Mozambique gas field to Exxon. And why it partnered up with BP on the Zohr project. Basically, you can get a piece of Eni's high profile projects without buying Eni and it's heavy debt load. In my opinion, Exxon's solid balance sheet is the better option. 
The next reason to prefer Exxon over Eni is the basic business of each company. Exxon is a truly integrated oil major, with oil and natural gas drilling balanced against its chemicals and refining assets. To highlight the benefit of this, Exxon's earnings after income taxes fell by roughly 50% in 2015, a really bad year for all oil companies. But earnings at its chemicals business were up slightly year over year and its downstream earnings more than doubled, as refining benefited from falling oil prices. That helped offset the massive 75% drop in earnings from its upstream oil and gas drilling business. In fact, the downstream business earned almost as much on an absolute basis as the upstream business that year. This balanced approach allowed Exxon to report a profit for the full year.   
Now compare that to Eni, which has a diversified business but is more heavily weighted toward exploration and production. Adjusted net profit in 2015 fell a massive 90%, with asset write downs pushing the company's earnings deep into the red. It simply didn't have the balance to offset the decline on the oil and natural gas side of the business. To give you an idea of the scale of the problem, in 2015 adjusted earnings in the downstream business totaled 387 million euro compared to the 4.1 billion euro provided by the upstream segment. In other words, when Eni needed diversification its downstream business was little more than a rounding error. I'll take Exxon's truly diversified business, thanks.     
If Eni's big yield attracted you to the name, then step back and take a look at the company's dividend history. Between 2014 and 2015 it cut the dividend roughly 30%. Essentially, at the first sign of trouble shareholders took a dividend haircut. When you look at Eni's leverage relative to Exxon and the relative lack of diversification in its business you can see why that decision was made. And it was probably the right move for the company. However, if you were relying on those dividend checks, the cut would have hurt. At this point you shouldn't look at Eni's dividend as secure in any environment. (Note that currency fluctuations have recently pushed Eni's dividend even lower in dollar terms, in euros it has remained at the same level since the cut.)  

E DIVIDEND PER SHARE (ANNUAL) DATA BY YCHARTS.
ExxonMobil, on the other hand, used its balance sheet strength and truly diversified business model to keep rewarding investors with annual dividend increases each year through the downturn. The company's annual streak is now up to 35 consecutive years, making Exxon a dividend aristocrat. Recent hikes have been more modest than historical increases, but that's to be expected in a difficult industry environment. The real point is that Exxon wins hands down compared to Eni when it comes to returning value to shareholders via a consistently growing dividend.  
Eni offers investors a massive yield right now. But once you look past that, the positives at the oil giant just don't offset the negatives. Eni has less financial flexibility than Exxon, a less than inspiring dividend track record on an absolute and relative basis, and it lacks the diversification that Exxon's business offers -- a difference that showed up notably in 2015 when Eni chose to trim its dividend. Exxon has proven its dividend commitment for 35 consecutive years and despite the relatively low yield, I'd rather own Exxon than Eni any day.
