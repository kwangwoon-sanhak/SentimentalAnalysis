Shares of ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are getting pounded again on Monday and were down 6% at 3:15 p.m. EST. Today's drop follows a similar fall last Friday, which was the stock's worst day since 2011.
Several factors are fueling today's sell-off in ExxonMobil. First, the stock market tumble from last week has intensified today, which is taking virtually everything down with it, including the price of oil. That drop in oil is adding fuel to Exxon's downdraft, which is still in free fall after last week's post-earnings drubbing when the oil company's fourth-quarter results came in well below expectations.

Heading into the report, analysts expected that Exxon would earn $1.03 per share, fueled by a rapid rise in oil prices. However, the company only turned in $0.88 per share in earnings. Several factors fueled the miss, including a 3% drop in production and much weaker international refining margins. Because of that, operating cash flow came in slightly below the third quarter and matched the year-ago period. This was a surprise, since the oil giant should have produced a gusher of cash flow thanks to higher oil prices.
That unexpectedly poor quarter soured investors on the company at the worst possible moment because it came just as the stock market seems to have run out of gas. That's leading investors to scramble to sell so they can lock in profits just in case the bottom drops out of the market.
There's no doubt that Exxon's fourth-quarter report was disappointing, especially compared to rivals that reported stronger numbers. That said, the company is investing heavily to turn things around so it can grow earnings and cash flow in the coming years, including announcing a $50 billion bet on the U.S. energy sector. If that plan works, it could richly reward investors who choose to take advantage of the oil giant's recent sell-off.

With oil prices on the rise, there was a lot of optimism headed into the fourth quarter for oil and gas producers. Then, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) released its results and squashed some of those positive vibes. Despite oil prices rising to more than $65 a barrel for most of the quarter, ExxonMobil's adjusted earnings came in strangely lower than this time last year.
Let's sift through the company's most recent results to see what happened in the quarter.

Of course, ExxonMobil's performance wasn't quite as strong as that net income result might suggest because the company received a large gift from Uncle Sam in the form of a tax cut that lowered the company's deferred tax liabilities by $5.9 billion. Management also used that large one-time gain as a way to make about $1.3 billion in asset impairments seem much more palatable to investors. If we were to strip out the one-time gains and charges, net income for the quarter would have been $3.7 billion compared to $3.8 billion this time last year. 
Two things changed significantly this past quarter: Upstream operating earnings gained about $1 billion while refining income declined $600 million. Both of these drastic changes can be attributed to the rapid increase in Brent oil prices -- the international benchmark price -- in the fourth quarter. Since changes in price for refined products tend to lag crude prices a little, a rapid increase in crude can quickly eat into margins.

On ExxonMobil's most recent conference call, one analyst raised some concerns about the company's upstream results and how the company's rates of return have declined a bit. Upstream continues to be its most significant business by far and so much of its capital spending goes into it, but the company's investor relations VP, Jeff Woodbury, skirted the question by saying that it intends to address the issue during its upcoming analyst day presentation:
I certainly acknowledge the drop that we've seen in the upstream business and the return on capital employed. And I think we're going to lay out a growth plan that's going to demonstrate where we're heading, not only to enhance the upstream return but furthermore continue to build in the downstream and chemical businesses, which I think you recognize are very important to the corporation as a whole given our integrated business model.

It seems as though this rough patch couldn't come at a worse time for ExxonMobil. There have been some concerns about its upstream production for the past year or so, and this report of declining production and lower rates of return aren't great when its largest competitor, Royal Dutch Shell, has shown its investors a clear vision of its future and is backing those plans up with significant increases in earnings and free cash flow. 
Woodbury noted on the conference call that it intends to present a more defined plan for growth and better profitability during its analyst day presentation in March. So it's entirely possible that investor sentiment will change in a month or so. After all, its Permian Basin assets and the growing Guyana project suggest it has some incredibly lucrative projects to develop over the next several years that could turn things around by the end of the decade.
