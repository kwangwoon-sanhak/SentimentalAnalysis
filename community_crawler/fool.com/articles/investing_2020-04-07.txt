The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) attempted to extend the rally on Tuesday, with the index up 3.1% by 12:30 p.m. EDT. Some early signs that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. is beginning to slow thanks to social distancing measures may be giving investors a reason to be optimistic.
The number of cases and deaths from the virus will continue to rise in the coming weeks, and the extent of the economic impact is still to be determined. So far, there are over 375,000 confirmed cases and over 11,800 deaths from the virus in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University.
Rallying hard on Tuesday were ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Disney (NYSE:DIS). Exxon was up after the oil major announced significant cuts to capital investments and operating costs, while Disney rose after a report of a possible May start to the MLB season.
Oil prices are depressed due to a combination of oversupply and weak demand stemming from the novel coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, oil major ExxonMobil announced plans to slash both capital spending and operating expenses in response to the difficult environment. The stock was up 5.4% by early afternoon.

Exxon now expects to spend about $23 billion on capital investments in 2020, down from a previous outlook of $33 billion. The company will also cut cash operating expenses by 15%, driven partly by increased efficiencies and expected lower energy costs. The most significant capital spending cuts will be in the Permian Basin.
Despite the deep reduction in capital spending, Exxon still expects to meet various longer-term targets. The company still sees $20 billion going into U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing facilities as part of a 2017 initiative, and it expects total U.S. investment over five years starting in 2018 to reach the proposed $50 billion.
In the long run, Exxon CEO Darren Woods expects demand for energy to grow once the crisis is over: "The long-term fundamentals that underpin the company's business plans have not changed -- population and energy demand will grow, and the economy will rebound."
While Exxon stock rallied on Tuesday, shares of the energy giant remain about 49% below their 52-week high.
Disney's ESPN reported on Tuesday that Major League Baseball is working on a plan to start the season as early as May. Some high-ranking federal public health officials support the plan, according to ESPN's sources.
The plan involves all 30 MLB teams playing games at stadiums in the Phoenix area, with no fans. Stadiums would include the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks as well as spring training facilities and possibly other nearby fields. Players and staff would be sequestered in hotels, traveling only to and from the stadiums.
The possible return of baseball to TV would be good news for ESPN. With professional sports shut down in the U.S. due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cable sports network has lost its main source of programming. Without the draw of live sports, the revenue hit from lost advertising opportunities is significant. An analyst at MoffettNathanson estimates Disney could lose $481 million in ad revenue from the shutdown of the NBA alone.
This loss of sports advertising revenue is only one of Disney's problems. The company's U.S. parks are closed indefinitely as the pandemic continues to spread, and movie releases are being postponed. Most of Disney's empire is suffering due to the pandemic.
A return of baseball to TV in May would help Disney regain some lost revenue, and it could draw more viewers than usual if fans are hungry for live sports. Shares of Disney were up 4.9% by early afternoon, but the stock is still down around 32% from its 52-week high.

Oil prices turned upward today, with WTI, the U.S. oil price benchmark, rising roughly 2% by 10:45 a.m. EDT. Fueling that rally was news that U.S. producers are starting to cut their output in a move that will help ease the glut of oil filling up storage terminals around the country. Those dual catalysts sent most energy stocks soaring, including shares of several major producers. Among the notable movers were Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Apache (NASDAQ:APA), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), and Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR), which were all soaring more than 10% by early-morning trading. Meanwhile, oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) also rallied today, rising more than 5% by midmorning. 
One of the main catalysts for the rise in oil prices and the shares of producers was a report that U.S. shale drillers are about to start cutting output. Continental Resources executive chairman Harold Hamm told S&P Global Platts that he believes U.S. producers will voluntarily slash their production by 30% to 35% in the near term. However, he said that this wasn't in response to a coordinated effort with OPEC but because there isn't enough demand or storage space.

Hamm's company followed through on those comments by being the first U.S. producer to reduce its production. Continental expects to slash its output by 30% in April and May. That's in part because a CVR Refining (NYSE:CVI) facility in Oklahoma asked the company to reduce the amount of oil it supplies to the refinery by 25% due to lack of demand. Before voluntarily reducing its output, Continental anticipated that its production would naturally decline by about 5% this year because it had cut its drilling budget and wouldn't complete enough new wells to offset the lost output from legacy ones.  
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil joined the growing number of producers that have slashed spending. The oil giant cut its capital budget by $10 billion, or 30%, and also aims to reduce its operating expenses by 15%. While Exxon isn't joining Continental in reducing its output, the budget reduction will affect its production in the coming months because the company won't complete as many new wells in the Permian Basin as initially expected. It predicts its output in that region will decline by 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an even deeper cut coming in 2021, given the timing of its well completion program. However, the company plans to maintain its dividend. That's something Continental isn't doing; it suspended its payout today. 
The Permian production of Diamondback Energy and Apache will also fall this year due to previously announced spending cuts. Apache has stopped drilling in the region. Meanwhile, Diamondback expects its oil production to fall by 3.5% this year as it takes a one-to-three-month break on completing new wells in the region. However, given the industry's storage issues, it's possible that Apache, Diamondback, and other producers in that Texas oil basin will reduce their output either voluntarily or by regulatory decree. 
Murphy Oil has also cut its spending and activity levels in response to lower oil prices. It initially slashed its capital budget by 35% by delaying some projects in the Gulf of Mexico as well as suspending activity in the Eagle Ford Shale. However, it cut capital spending again this month, reducing it by another 18%, 46% overall. Murphy also slashed its dividend in half, joining Apache, which cut its payout by 90% last month to conserve cash.  
Oil companies continue to cut deeply due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many started by slashing capital spending. However, they've since cut even deeper by reducing production and their dividends to adjust to the tremendous dislocation in the oil market. These moves will help stabilize the oil market until demand starts coming back once the pandemic subsides.

ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) just became the latest oil company to slash its spending amid crashing crude prices. The energy giant on Tuesday announced it would be reducing its 2020 capital budget by 30% from $33 billion to $23 billion, and cutting operating expenses by 15%. These moves will help offset some of the impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak, which has cratered demand for oil and taken prices down with it. 
It was just over a month ago that ExxonMobil reaffirmed its spending plans for this year. During its March 5 investor day meeting, CEO Darren Woods said the company would "use the strength of our balance sheet to invest through the cycle." However, market conditions have significantly deteriorated since then, putting pressure on ExxonMobil's balance sheet, which led S&P Global to downgrade its credit rating.

The bulk of the capital spending cuts will fall on its Permian Basin operations, where ExxonMobil can more quickly respond to changes in the market environment. The company will reduce the pace at which it drills and completes wells in that region until conditions improve.
ExxonMobil expects to continue developing its offshore resources in Guyana, where it is on track to start its project's second phase in 2022. However, it did warn of a potential delay of six to 12 months for the third phase because it is deferring some activity on that project. Meanwhile, it also anticipates delaying a final investment decision for its Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique.
Despite the spending cuts and activity reductions, ExxonMobil did maintain its long-term outlook. Further, the company says it plans to preserve its dividend. However, management stated that it would "continue evaluating the impacts of decreased demand on its 2020 production levels as well as longer-term production impacts" and make additional reductions to both spending and its outlook if necessary.

Shares of integrated oil majors ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A)(NYSE:RDS.B), and BP (NYSE:BP) lost more than 20% of their value in March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Shell's A and B shares fell 20.8% and 26.7%, respectively, while Exxon shares tumbled 26.2% and BP shares plunged 22.1%.
All three companies underperformed the S&P 500, which was only down 12.5% for the month. But they also all handily outperformed the overall oil and gas industry, as measured by the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production ETF, which was down 46.5% for the month.

Unsurprisingly, the companies posted their biggest losses between March 6 and 9, after the collapse of the OPEC+ alliance, which consisted of Russia and the OPEC member countries, led by Saudi Arabia. An OPEC+ agreement limiting production was set to expire at the end of March, and  Russia refused to renew it, vowing instead to dramatically increase production. In response, Saudi Arabia announced that it, too, would increase production. Virtually all of the OPEC members followed suit, leaving the global oil markets awash in cheap fuel.
Oil prices tumbled instantly, and so did the share prices of oil companies, including the integrated majors. They continued trending downward as Brent crude prices slid from more than $45/barrel on March 6 to less than $27/barrel on March 18. 
On March 23, shares popped a bit thanks to announcements by Shell and French oil major Total that they were cutting their 2020 capital spending and suspending share buyback programs. Wall Street interpreted these moves as protecting against potential dividend cuts, especially comforting since Shell's yield had soared above 19%.
It extended the benefit of the doubt to ExxonMobil and BP despite prior comments from Exxon CEO Darren Woods that he was planning to increase, rather than decrease, capital spending in 2020. Woods issued a statement on March 16 but would only commit to "evaluating" significant expense reductions.
The oil majors have been down this road before. After oil prices crashed from over $100/barrel in 2014 to around $30/barrel in 2015, they had to cut expenses, streamline their operations, add some debt to their balance sheets, and lean heavily on their downstream -- refining and marketing arms -- to keep enough cash coming in to fund their dividends.
All of them were successful in maintaining (Shell, BP) or increasing (ExxonMobil) their dividends through the price downturn, which lasted into 2017. BP and Shell offered an optional scrip dividend program, in which dividends were paid in new shares to help preserve cash. That could be an option for the oil majors this time around if cash flow gets dicey.
And it might get dicey indeed, because not only did oil prices fall to lower levels in March than they did between 2014 and 2017, but prices for refined products like fuel and petrochemicals have also tumbled thanks to high supply and weak demand. The oil majors were already reporting poor numbers from their downstream segments in their Q4 2019 earnings reports. That's only gotten worse as the coronavirus has shut down travel across the globe.
ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell are unlikely to cut their dividends, even in an economic climate as bleak as this one. They all have good credit ratings and plenty of levers they can pull -- including taking on debt or offering scrip dividends -- to preserve cash to keep those payouts coming. And with prices down, their dividend yields are looking quite attractive right now. 
At some point, the coronavirus pandemic will ebb, and air and automobile travel will resume. Also, at some point the oil market will settle upon a price and level of global production that's sustainable (at least, for a while). How long either of these things will take, though, is anyone's guess, and in the meantime, it's likely to be a volatile time for energy industry stocks, even the most stable ones. 
Dividend investors who are buying for the long term should seriously consider taking this opportunity to pick up shares of ExxonMobil, BP, or Royal Dutch Shell, if they can stomach the volatility and the possibility that share prices may fall even further in the short term.
