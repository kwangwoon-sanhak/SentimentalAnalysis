Shares of U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) rose a touch over 5% at one point in morning trading on Thursday. Although it pulled back from that level in early afternoon action, the stock was still up by around 4% at 1 p.m. EDT today. There was no material company news, but the broader energy market and a mention in The Wall Street Journal provided some notable support to the shares.  
The headlines over the last few days have been focused on Exxon potentially losing its throne as the largest U.S. energy company to peer Chevron and/or utility and renewable power giant NextEra Energy. To put some numbers on that, Exxon's market cap has declined from a peak of around $450 billion in 2014 to a recent level of around $147 billion. Although still quite large, that's pretty much neck and neck with Chevron and NextEra.

While investors contemplate the bragging rights of being the "biggest" energy company, Exxon remains a dominant oil business. And one that has decided to double down on oil despite low prices and the increasing shift away from carbon-based energy options. Like its peers, it has pulled back on investment in the face of low energy prices, but it has not shifted its dedication to oil and the various products derived from it.
In fact, this oil focus got a positive mention in the Journal, which suggested that rising oil prices could benefit Exxon and its sizable chemicals business more than its peers. And, as if on cue, West Texas Intermediate oil prices have risen above the important $40 per barrel level, below which few companies can profitably drill. Notably, U.S. onshore is one of the key focus areas for Exxon as it looks to ramp up its production over time. The company's shares likely got a bit of a lift from both the Journal article and the positive oil price movement.   
Exxon's stock has been hit hard by falling energy prices, pushing its yield above 10%. There are very legitimate concerns among investors that it won't be able to maintain its dividend at the current level if industry conditions don't improve. But if oil prices can mount a sustained rally, those concerns would ease considerably. One day's move and one positive news article don't change the big picture here, but investors can't be blamed for being excited by some positive news after so many negatives.
And yet the only thing that investors can truly expect with any certainty from here is continued volatility in the energy patch. Indeed, tomorrow could just as easily add to today's early gains as completely reverse them. Conservative long-term investors might want to tread carefully.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is now the largest U.S. oil company by market cap after overtaking big-oil rival ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). Chevron closed trading on Wednesday with a $142 billion market cap, eclipsing Exxon's $141.6 billion value. But both have fallen below renewable energy giant NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), which has surged to a $145.5 billion market value this year. 
While Chevon is now the largest U.S. oil company, it's a fraction of its former self. At its peak in 2014, the company had a $256 billion market cap. Shares have since fallen more than 45% from their high, with most of that damage coming this year as they've declined 39% due to crashing crude prices caused by the coronavirus.

ExxonMobil is also a shell of a once-mighty oil giant. At its peak in 2007, it had a more than $500 billion market cap. It has since shed more than 70% of its value, including cratering 52% this year. Like Chevron, lower oil prices are a major factor.
But oil price volatility is only part of the story. Another significant driver is a shift in investor sentiment away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Not only are renewables cleaner, but they're also growing faster due to the rapid decline in costs. That's allowing utilities like NextEra Energy to generate strong earnings growth while oil giants like Exxon and Chevron are seeing their profits erode as crude prices crumble.
That trend will likely become even more pronounced given the chilling demand forecast of fellow big-oil producer BP (NYSE:BP), which estimates that it could have already peaked. That's leading BP to join investors in pivoting toward renewables so that it's not left in the dust.

Investing in 2020 has been an adventure. In a roughly six-month span, the widely followed S&P 500 lost over a third of its value, clawed everything back, and even gained. It was the steepest 30%-plus bear market decline we've ever seen, as well as the quickest rebound to new highs from a bear market bottom in history.
Besides giving long-term investors opportunities to scoop up great companies at bargain prices, this heightened volatility has also lured millennial and/or novice investors into equities. Online investing app Robinhood, which is best known for its commission-free trades and gifts of stock shares to new members, has signed up millions of people. The average age of these new short-term-focused traders is 31. 
Unfortunately, not all of the companies that Robinhood investors flock to are Wall Street favorites. Wall Street hates the following three stocks that you can find among Robinhood's top 50 holdings.

It's no secret that millennial investors are enamored with electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and none is more popular than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Robinhood's investors are known to chase momentum stocks. Since Tesla was recently up over 1,000% on a trailing-12-month basis at one point, it fits the profile.
Yet Tesla isn't that well-liked on Wall Street. Keeping in mind that underperform and sell ratings are rare (often because investment banks don't want to burn bridges with the companies they're rating), September featured eight strong buy or buy ratings, 15 hold ratings, and 10 underperform or sell-equivalent ratings. Put another way, fewer than 1 in 4 Wall Street analysts views Tesla as a stock to buy right now.
Why the skepticism? One reason might be Tesla's lack of a full-year generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla has often leaned on EV credit to bolster its adjusted profitability, but hasn't been able to generate a full-year GAAP profit. That's a bit worrisome for a company valued at almost $400 billion.
Tesla's valuation is also a tough pill to swallow. Putting aside its triple-digit forward price-to-earnings ratio for a moment, Tesla is on track to deliver roughly 500,000 EVs in 2020. Comparatively, other major auto stocks are producing anywhere from 3 million to 8 million vehicles annually. Tesla's valuation is nearly equal to many of the largest traditional automakers put together, yet it remains unprofitable on a full-year GAAP basis.
Tesla is a stock I wouldn't buy because I also question the sustainability of its competitive advantages. Tesla has certainly benefited from its first-mover advantage in mass-produced EVs and its battery range. But it's not going to be the only show in town. General Motors, Ford, and pretty much every major automaker is tossing billions (or tens of billions) of dollars at EVs and autonomous vehicles in the coming years. I'd say Wall Street is right to question Tesla's valuation here.

Millennial and novice investors are also gung-ho on marijuana stocks, with Canadian licensed producer Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) once holding the title of most-held stock on the entire Robinhood platform.
However, there's been a pretty clear bifurcation on favorability when it comes to North American pot stocks. Weed companies in the U.S. are thriving, while our neighbors to the north are struggling badly. That's meant little love for Aurora Cannabis. According to Robinhood, only 17% of analysts currently have a buy rating on Aurora, with 78% at hold and 6% at the equivalent of a sell rating.
It's certainly not hard to see why Wall Street is skeptical of the company. Since mid-March 2019, Aurora Cannabis' stock has lost more than 96% of its value. Once expected to lead North America in marijuana output, Aurora has closed five of its smaller cultivation farms, halted production on its two largest projects to conserve capital, and sold its greenhouse in Exeter, Ontario, which it never retrofit for cannabis production. Though Aurora is selling more cannabis of late, its value brands are dominating those sales, which means operating margins are hurting.
Though at least some of Canada's shortcomings can be blamed on regulatory issues, problems specific to Aurora deserve a wag of the finger from investors. The company has been issuing stock in droves to raise capital for funding acquisitions and day-to-day operations. In six years, Aurora's reverse-split-adjusted share count has ballooned from 1.3 million to 115.2 million, meaning it's constantly diluting existing shareholders.
Aurora also grossly overpaid for each and every one of its acquisitions since August 2016. In fiscal 2020, the company wrote down well over $2 billion Canadian in goodwill and intangible assets tied to these deals.
Aurora Cannabis has shown little to inspire confidence and should be avoided.

Robinhood investors are also fans of Big Oil. Integrated oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is a top-50 holding on the platform that Wall Street doesn't exactly love.
In September, 25 Wall Street analysts had a rating issued on the company, with two calling it a strong buy, 18 labeling it a hold, and five designating the company an underperform or sell. That's less than 10% of Wall Street investment banks believing ExxonMobil was worth buying as of last month.
Why no love for ExxonMobil? In the short run, the company is contending with a historic plunge in crude oil demand tied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although economic activity is rising, there's no way for any developed economy to fully step on the gas until there's a workable vaccine. This means continued pressure and potential oversupply on crude demand for the foreseeable future.
The other problem is the continued push toward renewable energy sources in developed countries. Make no mistake, oil isn't going away anytime soon -- but the developed world's reliance on fossil fuels may begin to wane, putting ExxonMobil's future growth prospects into doubt.
For what it's worth, ExxonMobil is the only one of these three hated stocks that I believe is worth buying. As an integrated company, it's able to lean on its downstream refining and petrochemical operations when crude prices weaken. It also has ample production opportunities overseas to meet developed and emerging market demand.
This is the first time in 35 years that ExxonMobil has been so cheap relative to its book value. In my view, this makes it a compelling buy at its current price.
