The crude oil sell-off has gone from bad to worse. Brent futures are on track to lose 9% on March 6, while West Texas crude is down 9.5% with only a couple of hours remaining in the final trading session of the week. Today's massive drop was started by news that Russia wasn't prepared to play ball with OPEC, which had proposed a 1.5 million-barrel daily cut by OPEC and its OPEC+ partners, of which Russia is most-prominent. 
The proposal included 1 million barrels of daily production that OPEC member states had agreed to take, with the additional half-million daily barrels in cuts to come from Russia and the other non-OPEC members of the OPEC+ group. Russia would be expected to bear the brunt of most of those extra cuts, and so far is proving unwilling to do so.

Today's massive sell-off is partly a product of timing, as traders fight to get out the door before the end of the week's trading. But there are serious structural concerns with oil markets behind the selling. Global oil consumption is already expected to fall in the first quarter due to the economic impacts of coronavirus on China, and a lack of substantial cuts in output by major producers would result in an increase in the oversupply. 
Markets are reacting as expected to these fears, sending most oil stocks down sharply. At this writing, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shares are down 5% on the day and have shed nearly 25% of their value over the past month, while small oil producer Denbury Resources (NYSE:DNR) stock has fallen 11% on the day and 45% since early February. The sell-off isn't limited to companies that produce oil either: Noble Corp (NYSE:NE), the offshore oil and gas drilling specialist, has lost half its value over the same period, after today's 18% sell-off. 
At current prices, oil is already at multi-year lows. West Texas crude is at $41.54 at this writing, the lowest since April of 2016, while Brent Crude is at $45.30, the lowest it has been since briefly falling below $45 in August 2015. What happens next will largely depend on what major state-controlled producers like Russia and the OPEC member states decide to do, but so long as the impact of coronavirus on global oil consumption remains in play, oil markets are likely to remain incredibly volatile. 
Investors looking for opportunity are moving away from the uncertainty of energy markets, with dividend stocks coming more into favor, particularly with interest rates at record lows.

Crude oil prices tanked on Friday, with both WTI (the U.S. benchmark price) and Brent (the global benchmark) tumbling more than 8.5% by 11:30 a.m. EST. That sell-off in the oil market drove down shares of oil producers, with several big names plunging. Among the notable movers were Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), which all fell more than 10% this morning. Meanwhile, oil behemoth ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) shed more than 5% of its value at one point, wiping away another $10 billion from its market capitalization.
Oil tumbled after reports surfaced that Russia -- a key ally in the OPEC alliance (known as OPEC+) to curb oil supplies -- has rejected OPEC's recommendation of making extra production cuts. In the country's view, a bigger reduction in oil supplies won't solve the market's current problems. OPEC had wanted an additional 1.5 million barrels per day of production cuts through the end of this year to offset the impact that the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak is having on oil demand.

News that Russia won't agree to additional cuts sent WTI down to $42 a barrel and pushed Brent to around $45 a barrel. Analysts, however, believe that both could fall below $40 a barrel if OPEC and Russia don't enact deeper cuts.
Those oil price points are painful for U.S.-focused producers, even those with low operating costs like Continental Resources, Devon Energy, and Diamondback Energy. Devon Energy, for example, needs WTI to average $46.50 per barrel to support its two-year operating plan. Diamondback Energy, meanwhile, needs oil at $47.50 a barrel this year so that it can generate enough cash to support its capital budget and dividend. Continental Resources has an even higher break-even level of around $50 a barrel. With crude slumping below those levels, these drillers might need to reduce their budgets so that they don't outspend cash flow.
Occidental Petroleum, meanwhile, made a massive bet on higher oil prices last year when it bought Anadarko Petroleum for $55 billion. It planned to use the cash flow generated at higher oil prices, as well as the proceeds from asset sales, to quickly repay the debt it took on to complete that transaction. However, with crude tumbling, investors are growing more worried that Occidental might need to cut its dividend -- which now yields close to an eye-popping 11% -- so that it can get its balance sheet back on solid ground.
ExxonMobil, meanwhile, recently reaffirmed its plan to keep spending even though crude prices have weakened considerably this year. That's because the company believes the current price swing isn't permanent. Investors and analysts, however, worry that the company's debt will keep ballooning, which might force it to reduce its dividend, which now yields around 7%.
With Russia resisting deeper oil production cuts, it doesn't appear as if OPEC will come to rescue the energy market this time. Because of that, crude prices could continue falling until the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak begins to subside and global oil demand starts improving. That could force oil companies in the U.S. to slash their drilling budgets so that they're not adding more supply to an already saturated oil market.
