You wouldn't be too far from the truth if you think the choice between ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is kind of like flipping a coin. But there are some important, though perhaps small, differences between the two oil giants that can make a big difference in which one you actually choose. Here's what you need to know to figure out which one is the better buy for you, ExxonMobil Corporation or Chevron Corporation.
One of the main reasons to look at Exxon and Chevron is dividend income. Right now, Exxon offers a yield of around 4.2%, while Chevron's yield is closer to 3.9%. That's a reversal of the typical pattern. For most of the last 20 years, Chevron has yielded more than Exxon. That said, if you are looking to maximize current income, Exxon clearly wins, here.

Chevron's yield has spiked to around the current level three times over the past two decades or so, but it has generally been lower than it is today. The yield looks fairly generous historically. Exxon, meanwhile, hasn't seen its yield this high since the late 1990s. Using yield as a rough estimate of valuation, Exxon looks particularly cheap, and the yield very generous by historical standards. For yield seekers, Exxon is the better option, even if the difference is simply a few basis points.
Exxon has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years. Chevron has increased its dividend for 31 years. Exxon is again the winner, but not by much. However, there's a deeper story, here. During the deep oil downturn that started in mid-2014, Chevron held its dividend constant for 10 consecutive quarters. That's two and half years without a dividend increase -- a long time for investors to wait (and worry) during an industry soft patch. The only reason the annual streak remained alive was because of the mid-year timing of its dividend hikes.

Exxon, on the other hand, increased its dividend each and every year through the downturn. Those regular dividend hikes provided a statement to shareholders about management's still upbeat view of the future. So, while the big picture is similar here, Exxon gets the nod on dividend history as well. To be fair, a lot of the major oil companies paused like Chevron did during this time period, but that just makes Exxon's commitment to rewarding shareholders with regular dividend increases that much more notable. 
Over the past decade, the annualized growth in Chevron's dividend was 6.7%. That's roughly twice the historical rate of inflation growth. A solid number that investors should look upon favorably. However, Exxon's dividend grew at an annualized 8.4% over the same period. In fact, Exxon's annualized dividend growth has been higher over the trailing one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. The difference during any one of those periods isn't huge, but over time, Exxon has clearly rewarded investors with larger increases. That's another win for Exxon.

The balance sheet is another important factor to examine when you look at a dividend-paying stock. Too much debt makes it hard to support a dividend. Chevron's long-term debt makes up around 16% of its capital structure. That's a very low level of leverage for any company, and it suggests that Chevron is very strong financially. Even during the worst of the downturn that started in mid-2014, when oil giants across the board were using their balance sheets to muddle through a rough patch, Chevron's long-term debt only rose to about 20% of the capital structure.   
While Chevron's leverage stats look impressive, the story is even better at Exxon. Exxon's long-term debt is roughly 10% of its capital structure today. And at its worst, it only rose to around 15%. It's also worth noting that Chevron and Exxon are both toward the low end of their peer group when it comes to leverage. However, once again, Exxon wins even though the balance sheets of both companies are strong today and remained strong during the downturn that started in mid-2014.   
Being able to sustain a growing dividend requires growth over the long term. And on that score, Chevron has been doing a better job lately. The company's production fell 1% in 2016, after a period in which oil majors were pulling back on spending. However, it rose 5% in 2017, and production growth has continued through the first nine months of 2018. Exxon's production fell 1% in 2016 and another 1.7% in 2017. Worse, Exxon's production continued to decline through the first nine months of 2018. This is one of the main reasons Exxon's yield is so high historically and relative to Chevron.   
That said, the two have very different plans for the future. Exxon is ramping up its exploration budget, with big projects planned in the U.S. onshore space, offshore, and in natural gas. It expects this spending to get production growth back on track. Early results suggest it is having some success, with production growing sequentially between the second and third quarters of 2018. The driving force of that shift was onshore U.S. drilling activity, which is only one of the company's big drilling projects. Chevron, meanwhile, has opted to hold its capital budget steady for the foreseeable future. That doesn't mean it can't continue to grow production, only that it has chosen a more conservative course than Exxon. That, in turn, could lead the two U.S. oil giants to switch places on production growth in the future.
Chevron looks like it wins on this front today because its past investments are paying off right now, but Exxon's spending could turn the tables in the future. Since the future is uncertain, Chevron gets the nod on this point, but only by a slim margin.
So far, Exxon seems to have the edge over Chevron, but the differences between the two companies aren't dramatic. You could pick either one and end up a long-term winner. And that brings up the last point: diversification. Both Exxon and Chevron are integrated oil giants, with investments that span from upstream (oil and gas wells) to downstream (refining and chemicals). And both have very public and prolific distribution, notably via branded gas stations.
However, through the first nine months of 2018, Exxon's downstream operations amounted to about a third of revenues. Chevron's downstream business made up about 22% over that span. That suggests Chevron is a little more exposed to the ups and downs of oil prices than Exxon because it has a heavier reliance on its upstream business. That's not a bad thing if you want to have a bias toward oil prices, but it helps explain why Chevron chose to pause its dividend when oil prices were falling. Exxon, with a bit more diversification (and a tad less leverage) was able to weather the storm in stride.   
This is a win for Exxon for investors with a conservative bent. However, for those who believe oil prices are going to head higher, Chevron could easily be called the winner. So really, it's a toss-up.
When you look at all of the points above, one thing becomes painfully clear: Exxon and Chevron are pretty similar. Neither one would be a bad energy stock to invest in. However, for most dividend investors, particularly those who are more conservative, Exxon's small wins in four of the six points above should give it the edge. The other two points weren't clear enough victories for either company to push Chevron ahead.

Commodities are the base products, pulled from the Earth beneath us, that allow material things to be created. The commodity category covers a broad range, from oil to iron ore to gold. Without these products you wouldn't have cars, buildings, or the fancy electronics increasingly dominating the world. If you are looking to cash in on these fundamental materials, then three of the top commodity stocks to look at in 2019 are ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (TSX:FNV).
Exxon's core business is drilling for oil and natural gas, key energy sources that power everything from cars to planes to the power plants that generate electricity. Oil and gas have been, and still are, key to economic growth, supporting living standards in developed markets and helping to raise the living standards of those in developing markets.

Exxon's business spans the entire value chain, from upstream (drilling) operations through downstream (refining and chemicals) businesses that create the products, such as gasoline, that actually get used in day-to-day life. This diversification helps provide balance, since oil price swings can be dramatic and swift, as the recent oil price drop clearly demonstrates. Low oil prices hurt the upstream side of Exxon's business, but as oil is also a key input on the downstream side, low oil prices are a net benefit on the other side of its operation.
In addition to diversification, Exxon is also highly conservative with its balance sheet. Long-term debt only makes up around 10% of the capital structure, placing the energy giant at the low end of its peer group on the leverage front. It is, essentially, designed to handle the ups and downs of the energy sector. Nothing proves that more than the incredible 36 consecutive years of annual dividend increases the company has amassed. And the stock looks relatively cheap today, trading with a yield (around 4.1%) that's higher than it has been since the 1990s and a price to tangible book value that's lower than it has been since around that same time.
BHP, formerly known as BHP Billiton, is one of the world's largest commodity producers, with material operations in iron ore (roughly 40% of underlying EBITA in fiscal 2018), copper (28%), coal (19%), and energy (14%). It also has a potash mine under consideration that, if built, would be among the largest in the world. The company, however, has recently gone through a big overhaul, jettisoning non-core mining assets (via the spin off of South32) and selling its onshore U.S. drilling business.
The goal of these moves was to streamline BHP down to just a few key investments, and within those investments to focus on just its best opportunities. In fact, the company recently held a conference dedicated to explaining its updated views on capital allocation. Management basically admitted that it hadn't been a particularly good steward of shareholder capital during the last downturn in the highly cyclical commodity space, and explained why its new approach would be more robust.

The changes highlighted include the streamlining and capital allocation efforts noted above, but also a renewed focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. To that end, BHP has cut long-term debt by 25% over the last two fiscal years. Long-term debt now makes up around 30% of the capital structure, a very reasonable figure that puts the company's leverage toward the low end of its closest industry peers.
With positions in some of the world's most important commodities, BHP looks like it is in fighting condition for the next commodity cycle. Adding to the allure is the stock's over-5% yield.
The last company up is Franco-Nevada, which doesn't mine or drill for anything. It's what's known as a streaming and royalty company. Effectively, it provides cash to commodity producers, notably gold and silver miners and oil drillers, in exchange for the right to purchase these commodities at reduced rates in the future (or for a preset piece of the sales price in the case of royalty deals). This saves Franco-Nevada from having to worry about the complications of working the assets in which it invests. Moreover, the company tends to have generally wide margins in both good markets and bad since the prices it pays are usually set as a percentage of current spot prices.
To give you an idea of just how protected the company is from commodity volatility, it has increased its dividend every year since going public in 2007. That's 11 years and counting, a period which included a deep commodity downturn. It's also interesting to note that Franco-Nevada has no long-term debt, generally preferring to issue shares as it inks new deals. This conservative approach makes a lot sense: The best investment opportunities for Franco-Nevada will be during downturns, since that's when miners are most desperate for cash and more willing to ink streaming and royalty deals. Maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet makes getting access to cash in downturns easier.

FNV EBITDA MARGIN (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS
Precious metals (largely gold) are the big commodity here, making up between 80% and 90% of the company's revenues over time. However, Franco-Nevada used the last oil downturn to opportunistically grow in the energy space, so there's some oil and gas exposure here too. That differentiates it from other streaming companies that are focused only on metals. Franco-Nevada is also one of the most diversified streaming companies, with 51 producing mines, 58 producing oil and gas assets, and over 260 other assets in some stage of development or exploration.
Although Franco-Nevada's 1.4% yield seems miserly compared to those of Exxon and BHP, it is actually a fair yield compared to its own history. And if you are looking for a way to invest in precious metals but want to sidestep volatility, the company's streaming model, strong financial foundation, and highly diversified portfolio are a great way to do it.
If you are looking to invest in commodities, an approach that balances risk and reward is key, as the sector is prone to swift and volatile ups and downs. Exxon, BHP, and Franco-Nevada are all conservatively financed and pretty well diversified, and they all offer investors a fair amount of income via dividends to help you stick around through the inevitable volatility you'll face. If you are looking for a commodity stock, all three should be on your short list today.

Earlier this year, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) unveiled an aggressive long-term growth plan that would see it double earnings and cash flow by 2025 without any help from higher oil prices. That strategy gives investors a clear road map of the company's future. Here's a look at what they can expect from the energy giant in the next five years.
ExxonMobil plans to take a multipronged approach to double its profitability in the coming years by expanding its upstream, downstream, and chemicals businesses. The oil giant expects to invest $24 billion on capital projects this year, with that ramping up to $28 billion in 2019 before averaging around $30 billion annually in the 2020 to 2025 time frame.

Exxon will invest the largest portion of this capital on the upstream side, where it expects to grow its production volumes from around 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/D) up to 5 million BOE/D by 2025. The company believes this will triple its upstream earnings without any improvement in oil prices since Exxon will focus on investing in its highest margin opportunities. Fueling the oil company's upstream growth would be the continued development of the Permian Basin as well as the start-up of 25 major projects across the world.
In the Permian Basin, Exxon expects to grow its production fivefold to as much as 800,000 BOE/D by continuing to drill new wells in the region. Exxon is supporting its ambitious expansion plan in the Permian by making strategic investments to ensure the development of new midstream assets so that it has open access to markets along the Gulf Coast as its output grows.
Meanwhile, Exxon is also investing in several needle-moving projects around the world. One of the most important is the development of its massive offshore oil discovery in Guyana. The company holds a 45% interest in this field and currently expects to build five offshore platforms that could produce 750,000 BOE/D by 2025. The company and its partners plan to finish the first phase next year, and already have two more in development, which could start up by mid-2022 and as early as 2023, respectively.

Another key aspect of Exxon's strategic growth plan is investing to expand the capacity of its refining and chemicals businesses, which are both expected to double their earnings by 2025. The company plans to spend more than $20 billion to expand these operations in the U.S. alone in the coming years. One project it's considering is expanding its refinery in Beaumont, Texas, which could nearly double that facility's capacity to more than 665,000 barrels per day by 2022. That would make it the largest refinery in the country. Meanwhile, Exxon recently approved a $1.9 billion expansion of its Baytown petrochemical complex, which would add a new plastics processing plant that should start up by 2023. Finally, Exxon formed a joint venture with Saudi Arabia's SABIC to build a new multibillion-dollar petrochemical plant in Texas, which could commence operations by 2022.
Exxon also plans to grow its downstream operations overseas. The company is investing in some projects at its Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands that should double that facility's margins by early next year. Exxon also has refinery projects planned in Singapore, Belgium, and the U.K. that should start up in the 2020 to 2024 time frame. Meanwhile, the company has a petrochemical complex in Asia that should also come online during that period.
ExxonMobil expects to grow its earnings by a significant amount over the next five years as it invests in expansion projects across its three business segments. Not only will these investments boost its profits, but they should support additional dividend increases and share repurchases. That combination of earnings growth and increasing shareholder returns could create significant value for investors in the coming years even if oil prices remain volatile, making Exxon a compelling energy stock to consider for the long term.
