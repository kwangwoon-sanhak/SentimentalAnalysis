At least one environmental group is threatening to appeal a judge's decision approving New Jersey's settlement of a pollution lawsuit with ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) in which the company would pay the state $225 million, a small fraction of the $8.9 billion that was first sought.
A court found on Aug. 25 that Exxon, which owned and operated oil refineries in northern New Jersey near Bayonne, had contaminated the waters, fields and wetlands in the area. The two sides had been litigating the case for 11 years until they agreed on a proposed settlement in February.
Environmental groups and their allies complained that the administration of Gov. Chris Christie was letting Exxon off easy, given the breadth of the contamination. Eight such groups, along with New Jersey State Sen. Raymond Lesniak, were denied the right to intervene in the case.
In his 81-page ruling, State Superior Court Judge Michael Hogan noted that the ruling also appeared to lack popular support. During a 60-day period of public comment, most of the 16,013 individuals who submitted their opinions to the court opposed the deal, it said.
Nevertheless, Hogan approved the deal, calling it "the product of arm's-length, adversarial negotiations between two highly motivated, sophisticated parties."
