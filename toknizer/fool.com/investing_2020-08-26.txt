Energy, industry, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, offers, enticing, 8, 5, yield, midstream, focused, Magellan, Midstream, Partners, NYSE, MMP, yield, even, higher, 10, If, looking, favor, energy, sector, income, opportunities, two, historically, conservative, players, worth, closer, look, Both, dealing, delicate, business, environment, one, names, appears, better, position, 
Exxon, one, largest, energy, companies, Earth, diversified, portfolio, runs, way, upstream, oil, natural, gas, drilling, downstream, chemicals, refining, segments, industry, Historically, provided, fair, amount, balance, business, downstream, operations, usually, benefiting, low, oil, prices, put, pressure, upstream, side, business, However, sides, material, strain, today, supply, demand, imbalance, caused, worldwide, COVID, 19, related, economic, shutdowns, To, put, simply, Exxon, suffering, 
The, company, balance, sheet, however, among, strongest, direct, peers, Although, times, tough, today, Exxon, highly, likely, make, rough, patch, one, piece, Management, also, made, clear, recently, Exxon, second, quarter, 2020, earnings, conference, call, dedicated, supporting, dividend, increased, annually, three, decades,

All, Exxon, future, hinges, greatly, direction, oil, prices, If, prices, rise, Exxon, dividend, likely, survive, If, prices, remain, weak, fall, linger, lower, levels, Exxon, may, forced, cut, dividend, keep, business, running, This, highlights, key, point, differentiation, Exxon, Magellan, 
While, Exxon, business, spans, spectrum, energy, sector, Magellan, focused, entirely, midstream, segment, This, master, limited, partnership, owns, collection, pipelines, storage, facilities, help, move, oil, refined, petroleum, products, products, turned, well, end, markets, eventually, serve, Roughly, 60, Magellan, assets, move, refined, products, rest, focused, moving, crude, oil, But, important, piece, puzzle, roughly, 85, business, fee, based, That, means, gets, paid, largely, use, assets, The, prices, products, flowing, system, less, important, demand, products, 
To, fair, demand, fell, economic, shutdowns, related, COVID, 19, In, fact, partnership, distributable, cash, flow, dropped, third, second, quarter, compared, period, 2019, That, good, news, However, Magellan, debt, EBITDA, ratio, historically, low, end, midstream, space, That, remains, true, even, though, risen, around, 2, 4, times, mid, 2019, around, 3, 2, times, today, It, built, handle, adversity,
