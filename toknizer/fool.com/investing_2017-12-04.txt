The, oil, industry, endured, brutal, 2016, crude, plunged, 20s, However, 2017, much, better, thanks, help, OPEC, along, several, non, member, nations, cut, production, drain, market, excess, supply, Those, actions, helped, prop, oil, prices, 10, average, around, 60, barrel, 
That, rebounding, price, driven, oil, stocks, higher, However, proven, case, every, instance, several, barely, budged, others, surprisingly, declined, value, including, big, oil, stocks, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Occidental, Petroleum, NYSE, OXY, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Investors, might, want, consider, taking, advantage, opportunity, buy, top, tier, oil, stocks, lackluster, showing, since, position, excel, even, crude, prices, fall, back, bit, 
Chevron, stock, risen, 1, 5, vastly, trails, nearly, 20, return, S, P, 500, That, underperformance, came, despite, fact, Chevron, significantly, improved, ability, operate, lower, oil, prices, After, outspending, cash, flow, whopping, 11, 4, billion, 2016, Chevron, spent, 3, 8, billion, less, pulled, third, quarter, Meanwhile, company, continue, generating, significant, free, cash, flow, next, bulk, major, projects, rearview, mirror, For, example, Chevron, estimates, 2020, produce, nearly, 4, billion, free, cash, flow, oil, averages, 50, barrel, Additionally, crude, rises, would, Chevron, cash, flow, company, noting, 60, oil, could, generate, much, 8, billion, free, cash, flow, 2020, number, potentially, rising, past, 12, billion, crude, 70s, 
Furthermore, Chevron, also, boasts, strengthening, balance, sheet, While, company, debt, ratio, hit, 24, 1, last, highest, level, still, less, 32, average, debt, ratio, big, oil, rivals, Meanwhile, company, expects, metric, remain, comfortable, level, 20, 25, next, even, oil, falls, back, 50, barrel, Because, Chevron, balance, sheet, strength, company, could, potentially, start, returning, cash, investors, coming, addition, already, generous, 3, 6, yielding, dividend, restarting, share, repurchase, program, That, could, provide, catalyst, finally, restarts, Chevron, stalled, stock, 
Occidental, Petroleum, stock, 1, despite, company, meaningful, progress, toward, achieving, goal, delivering, steady, production, growth, lower, oil, prices, The, company, working, get, point, pay, 4, 4, yielding, dividend, grow, production, 5, 8, per, within, cash, flow, 50, oil, higher, growth, rate, big, oil, companies, While, Occidental, still, work, reaches, level, clear, plan, get, point, led, strategy, boost, output, high, return, Permian, Basin, acreage, Occidental, currently, produces, 139, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, D, shale, resources, region, would, grow, low, cost, production, around, 200, 000, BOE, D, generate, cash, flow, needs, break, even, 50, barrel, While, means, needs, outspend, cash, flow, grows, level, company, ample, cash, financial, resources, bridge, gap, continue, funding, plan, interim, Though, crude, well, 50, barrel, moment, Occidental, might, need, tap, sources, finance, strategy, price, holds, 
Occidental, Petroleum, plan, potential, create, tremendous, value, long, term, investors, For, example, hits, breakeven, level, company, could, deliver, double, digit, total, annual, return, combination, attractive, dividend, yield, incremental, earnings, production, growth, even, crude, falls, back, 50, barrel, Meanwhile, oil, stays, current, level, heads, higher, company, would, generate, cash, needs, could, use, repurchase, shares, That, blend, high, yielding, dividend, average, production, growth, makes, Occidental, compelling, choice, investors, looking, low, risk, high, reward, option, 
ExxonMobil, stock, lost, disappointing, 7, 5, vastly, underperforming, market, crude, prices, It, hard, pinpoint, reason, stock, poor, performance, since, underlying, business, continues, improve, In, fact, oil, giant, produced, net, 400, million, excess, cash, flow, paying, 3, 7, yielding, dividend, investing, growth, projects, low, production, costs, Those, expansions, position, company, steady, production, cash, flow, growth, coming, even, oil, prices, slip, Like, Occidental, Petroleum, one, main, focuses, Exxon, strategy, increase, output, low, cost, Permian, Basin, company, plans, boost, production, 45, 2020, 
One, thing, impressive, Exxon, company, generating, much, excess, cash, current, oil, prices, already, started, buying, back, shares, repurchased, 500, million, stock, far, That, enabled, oil, giant, take, advantage, falling, stock, price, create, value, investors, road, Despite, repurchases, improvement, Exxon, operations, well, oil, prices, investors, still, opportunity, pick, shares, blue, chip, oil, stock, better, price, start, That, value, disconnect, alone, one, reason, Exxon, deserves, closer, look, 
This, trio, big, oil, giants, significantly, improved, ability, businesses, operate, lower, oil, prices, past, However, despite, efforts, stock, prices, followed, suit, even, though, crude, also, headed, higher, past, As, result, investors, unique, opportunity, buy, top, tier, oil, giants, appear, excellent, prices, That, makes, great, time, consider, adding, one, portfolio, three, way, prospering, even, crude, prices, slip,
