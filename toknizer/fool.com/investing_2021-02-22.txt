ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, behemoth, oil, patch, However, massive, size, part, problem, Like, large, ship, Exxon, takes, lot, time, change, course, It, seems, time, adjusts, market, conditions, shift, The, company, accordingly, struggled, grow, production, create, shareholder, value, recent, 
That, one, many, reasons, I, fan, Exxon, even, though, oil, prices, rebounded, recent, There, lots, energy, stocks, I, like, better, led, Brookfield, Renewable, NYSE, BEP, NYSE, BEPC, Devon, Energy, NYSE, DVN, Enbridge, NYSE, ENB, 
Exxon, faces, several, headwinds, none, prominent, accelerating, shift, toward, cleaner, alternative, energy, sources, While, Exxon, recently, launched, new, business, unit, focused, low, carbon, energy, I, think, bold, enough, strategy, It, could, get, left, behind, global, economy, transitions, renewable, energy, 
One, company, leading, charge, displace, Exxon, global, energy, market, Brookfield, Renewable, world, leader, renewable, energy, The, company, operates, developing, 42, gigawatts, GW, renewable, energy, capacity, enough, avoid, 56, million, tons, carbon, dioxide, equivalent, emissions, per, That, similar, planting, almost, 1, billion, trees, Compare, Exxon, low, carbon, strategy, building, carbon, capture, storage, projects, currently, capture, 9, million, tons, carbon, equivalent, planting, 150, million, trees, 
Meanwhile, Brookfield, renewable, powered, strategy, paid, significant, dividends, investors, The, company, generated, annualized, 20, compounded, total, return, last, two, decades, Exxon, compound, total, returns, fraction, 4, 6, annualized, 20, While, Exxon, believes, fossil, fuel, investment, strategy, pay, bigger, dividends, future, I, think, Brookfield, renewable, powered, plan, deliver, better, total, returns, 
While, higher, oil, prices, tend, lift, boats, oil, patch, Exxon, higher, cost, structure, peers, putting, disadvantage, For, example, Exxon, needs, oil, average, least, 60, barrel, generate, enough, cash, cover, capital, program, 6, 7, yielding, dividend, On, hand, Devon, Energy, finance, capital, plan, 2, 1, yielding, payout, sub, 40, oil, Devon, therefore, expects, generate, gusher, excess, cash, 50, oil, even, crude, oil, around, 60, barrel, 
Devon, plans, return, half, funds, investors, via, new, variable, dividend, program, It, recently, revealed, first, payment, double, quarterly, base, payout, Meanwhile, use, rest, cash, retains, shore, already, top, notch, balance, sheet, Contrast, Exxon, likely, return, additional, money, shareholders, even, oil, prices, keep, rising, since, needs, retain, funds, pay, debt, piled, last, Devon, ability, immediately, reward, investors, oil, prices, rise, makes, stand, compared, Exxon, still, needs, dig, last, hole, 
Last, fluctuations, oil, prices, cut, deeply, Exxon, cash, flow, direct, exposure, energy, prices, The, company, increase, dividend, first, time, 
Contrast, Canadian, energy, infrastructure, giant, Enbridge, Since, barely, exposure, fluctuations, oil, prices, volumes, fixed, rate, contracts, backing, business, Enbridge, cash, flow, continued, growing, last, That, enabled, increase, 7, 4, yielding, dividend, 26th, consecutive, Meanwhile, company, several, expansion, projects, way, including, investments, several, European, offshore, wind, farms, That, give, Enbridge, power, continue, growing, dividend, coming, On, hand, Exxon, payout, hanging, thread, could, head, lower, oil, prices, tumble, 
Exxon, massive, size, gave, competitive, advantage, oil, market, However, longer, case, ever, changing, market, conditions, make, hard, oil, behemoth, adjust, The, company, looks, likely, fall, behind, energy, transition, led, companies, like, Brookfield, Renewable, Meanwhile, upside, higher, oil, prices, nimbler, rivals, like, Devon, Finally, dividend, stock, making, less, appealing, Enbridge, That, I, prefer, trio, oil, giant, looks, like, best, days, past,
