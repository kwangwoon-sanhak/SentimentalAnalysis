As, probably, learned, one, way, another, past, two, stock, market, corrections, even, bear, markets, e, declines, least, 20, recent, high, inevitable, part, investing, cycle, 
Generally, speaking, never, know, ahead, time, correction, occur, long, last, steep, get, But, know, buying, stocks, periods, correction, always, smart, move, That, every, single, correction, bear, market, history, eventually, put, rearview, mirror, bull, market, rally, Thus, stock, market, falls, greater, opportunity, long, term, investors, benefit, 
The, coronavirus, disease, stock, market, crash, pushed, benchmark, S, P, 500, 34, 33, calendar, days, represented, one, heck, opportunity, investors, pick, high, quality, businesses, cheap, When, next, stock, market, crash, rears, head, COVID, 19, plunge, resumes, prepared, scoop, following, five, stocks, 
There, little, question, COVID, 19, mitigation, measures, include, shutdown, nonessential, businesses, going, hurt, advertising, industry, But, pain, perhaps, even, reason, give, dominant, company, ad, realm, Alphabet, NASDAQ, GOOG, NASDAQ, GOOGL, 
Alphabet, key, asset, Google, search, engine, according, Global, Stats, accounted, 92, worldwide, search, market, share, March, 2020, With, dominant, search, platform, Alphabet, little, issue, commanding, premium, price, points, ad, placement, likely, see, traffic, acquisition, costs, level, time, This, formula, higher, operating, margins, core, sales, driver, 
But, Google, search, driving, excitement, Google, Cloud, sales, doubled, since, 2017, YouTube, ad, revenue, 86, period, Cloud, margins, particular, interest, much, juicier, traditional, ad, margins, As, Google, Cloud, grows, larger, percentage, total, sales, Alphabet, cash, flow, could, really, soar, 
In, healthcare, space, company, I, stop, beating, drum, robotic, surgical, system, developer, Intuitive, Surgical, NASDAQ, ISRG, If, look, past, near, term, disruption, associated, delayed, elective, procedures, due, coronavirus, pandemic, see, company, long, term, double, digit, growth, rate, 
The, amazing, thing, Intuitive, Surgical, operating, margins, going, continue, improving, time, That, built, razor, blades, business, model, It, first, gets, hospitals, surgical, centers, hooked, purchase, da, Vinci, surgical, system, pricey, generally, low, margins, since, complex, system, build, The, blades, case, instruments, sold, surgical, procedure, well, servicing, performed, keep, machines, operating, well, As, number, installed, da, Vinci, systems, grows, percentage, sales, derived, higher, margin, segments, increase, 
This, also, company, plenty, opportunity, expand, use, surgical, system, currently, dominant, urology, gynecology, procedures, Management, anticipates, market, share, expansion, colorectal, thoracic, general, soft, tissue, surgery, come, 
IMAGE, SOURCE, AMAZON, 
If, coronavirus, stock, market, crash, taught, us, anything, Amazon, com, NASDAQ, AMZN, become, integral, source, consumption, Despite, weakness, early, March, shares, Amazon, wound, hitting, fresh, time, high, last, week, 
A, lot, folks, favor, Amazon, visible, highly, dominant, e, commerce, platform, There, question, e, commerce, generates, bulk, Amazon, revenue, 150, million, Prime, members, help, supplement, usually, pretty, anemic, retail, margins, With, Americans, stay, home, orders, respective, state, governors, Amazon, likely, see, holiday, season, level, buying, throughout, first, quarter, 
But, like, Alphabet, real, allure, faster, growing, cloud, service, segment, Amazon, Web, Services, AWS, Despite, accounting, 12, 5, total, sales, 2019, AWS, responsible, 63, 14, 5, billion, company, generated, operating, income, Since, cloud, margins, much, much, juicier, retail, margins, Amazon, expect, cash, flow, explosion, come, 
I, imagine, idea, buying, payment, processor, like, Mastercard, NYSE, MA, stock, market, crash, probably, sound, smart, After, consumer, spending, likely, decline, result, adverse, economic, conditions, But, payment, processor, Mastercard, proved, exceptionally, resilient, many, decades, 
It, currently, occupies, No, 2, spot, terms, credit, card, market, share, network, purchase, volume, U, S, bad, spot, considering, dependent, U, S, economy, consumption, Between, 2009, 2018, purchase, volume, traversing, Mastercard, U, S, network, surged, 477, billion, 811, billion, company, also, boosting, U, S, debit, card, market, share, roughly, 7, percentage, points, 29, 
Mastercard, also, plenty, opportunity, overseas, markets, estimated, 85, transactions, still, conducted, cash, Rolling, infrastructure, new, markets, may, costly, front, Mastercard, 48, profit, margin, trailing, 12, period, tough, overlook, 
As, one, last, note, Mastercard, payment, facilitator, lender, This, means, directly, exposed, credit, delinquencies, periods, economic, contraction, another, reason, margins, robust, 
Another, smart, stock, buy, stock, market, crash, integrated, oil, gas, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Similar, Mastercard, question, ExxonMobil, going, see, serious, short, term, disruption, periods, recession, crude, demand, falls, But, company, diverse, operations, big, reason, easily, weather, storm, 
Although, ExxonMobil, generates, profits, upstream, operations, includes, drilling, exploration, downstream, segment, helps, hedge, business, periods, crude, pricing, weakness, These, downstream, operations, e, g, refineries, petrochemical, plants, able, purchase, crude, much, lower, cost, periods, recession, As, costs, petroleum, based, products, decline, demand, among, consumers, enterprises, usually, rises, allowing, downstream, operations, shine, 
ExxonMobil, also, ability, reduce, outlays, significantly, improve, cash, flow, It, reduced, capital, expenditure, budget, 2020, 10, billion, recent, weeks, could, necessary, save, 14, 6, billion, annually, shelving, dividend, While, I, doubt, comes, point, ExxonMobil, levers, pull, oil, stocks, set, benefit, COVID, 19, pandemic, passed,
