On, April, 9, OPEC, led, Saudi, Arabia, joined, Russia, major, global, producers, agreement, take, record, amount, crude, oil, production, market, The, 10, million, barrel, per, day, reduction, output, participants, agreed, massive, change, course, help, establish, stability, global, oil, market, turmoil, And, anything, oil, market, needs, right, big, stiff, shot, stability, 
However, even, taking, 10, million, barrels, per, day, works, roughly, average, daily, production, Russia, Saudi, Arabia, increased, output, April, simply, enough, We, facing, unprecedented, levels, demand, destruction, COVID, 19, restrictions, oil, patch, headed, toward, brutal, 2020, potentially, beyond, 
Oil, stocks, crashed, result, falling, far, lower, rest, stock, market, even, recent, rebound, Strong, integrated, super, majors, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, around, 40, independent, oil, producers, Occidental, Petroleum, NYSE, OXY, Chesapeake, Energy, OTC, CHKA, Q, entered, oil, downturn, problems, 81, 68, pre, crash, highs, 
To, put, plainly, limited, exceptions, right, great, time, buy, oil, stocks, 
The, past, two, volatile, painful, modern, oil, industry, history, The, COVID, 19, pandemic, resulted, surely, remembered, steepest, fastest, decline, global, oil, demand, history, Here, brief, overview, oil, market, 2020, 
In, monthly, oil, markets, report, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, warned, global, oil, demand, going, fall, due, COVID, 19, At, time, agency, said, China, efforts, contain, outbreak, virus, behind, COVID, 19, would, cause, steep, drop, country, oil, consumption, dragging, global, quarterly, oil, demand, first, time, decade, 
After, gaining, almost, 10, value, following, IEA, warning, expectations, global, producers, would, cut, output, crude, oil, prices, started, falling, COVID, 19, cases, started, showing, outside, China, Saudi, Arabia, along, OPEC, expected, take, 1, million, barrels, per, day, production, market, If, agreement, happened, would, mark, least, third, time, five, OPEC, agreed, cut, output, stabilize, oil, prices, 
The, news, got, even, hopeful, OPEC, looked, pull, Russia, production, cuts, Then, Russia, balked, Saudi, Arabia, pivoted, market, stabilizer, war, Russia, global, supremacy, catching, U, S, shale, firmly, middle, Russia, said, would, also, open, taps, April, existing, production, deal, expired, industry, experts, pointing, U, S, shale, growth, recent, underpinning, Russia, refusal, cut, output, 
SAUDI, ARABIA, CRUDE, OIL, PRODUCTION, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
In, mid, march, Saudi, Arabia, raised, stakes, yet, The, country, oil, minister, said, would, increase, oil, production, 10, million, barrels, per, day, April, would, utilize, natural, gas, domestic, energy, freeing, even, crude, oil, sell, In, Saudi, Arabia, shifted, commiting, take, bulk, almost, 1, million, barrels, per, day, cuts, saying, would, increase, crude, exports, 40, May, The, United, Arab, Emirates, said, going, join, Saudi, Arabia, plans, increase, oil, output, 30, 
By, end, March, oil, markets, absolute, turmoil, COVID, 19, become, full, global, pandemic, global, oil, demand, already, fallen, sharply, Airline, travel, 80, Cruise, lines, halting, operations, Global, shipping, slowing, billions, people, stay, home, orders, pulling, hundreds, millions, vehicles, consume, billions, gallons, fuel, road, 
Things, gone, bad, far, far, worse, almost, anyone, thought, could, get, Top, oil, traders, predicted, global, oil, demand, would, fall, 20, million, barrels, per, day, equivalent, Russia, Saudi, Arabia, average, daily, production, Yet, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, continued, make, rumblings, plans, cut, production, least, without, major, commitments, others, 
On, April, 9, OPEC, finally, reaches, agreement, cut, 10, production, million, barrels, per, day, On, April, 10, G20, met, looking, get, commitments, even, global, oil, players, cut, production, much, additional, 5, billion, barrels, per, day, Combined, best, world, biggest, oil, producers, hoping, reach, would, far, biggest, agreement, reduce, output, history, 
But, come, close, enough, 
There, overstating, massive, 15, million, barrel, per, day, cut, would, beyond, pointing, terms, like, massive, used, recent, describe, production, cuts, 1, 5, million, barrels, per, day, 1, 10, size, hoped, cuts, 
But, even, unprecedented, production, cuts, put, oil, markets, back, equilibrium, Global, demand, predictions, 20, million, barrels, per, day, decline, could, prove, optimistic, More, recent, projections, say, demand, could, crater, much, 35, million, barrels, per, day, global, transportation, idled, energy, consumption, mandatory, business, closures, sharply, That, condition, prove, temporary, end, calendar, turns, May, likely, going, take, least, end, 2020, likely, longer, global, energy, consumption, returns, normal, levels, 
In, interim, global, oil, markets, become, increasingly, oversupplied, creating, bigger, short, term, problem, With, collapse, demand, industry, analysts, say, mid, may, roughly, one, U, S, run, oil, storage, capacity, Several, major, U, S, pipeline, operators, already, started, asking, oil, producer, customers, proof, buyers, oil, Over, past, two, weeks, alone, U, S, oil, inventories, increased, 29, million, barrels, gasoline, inventories, 18, million, barrels, 
The, U, S, economy, hence, oil, demand, likely, start, recovering, broad, way, June, Los, Angeles, county, announced, extension, stay, home, orders, mid, May, similar, announcements, expected, come, major, U, S, cities, states, weeks, ahead, Put, together, even, economy, starts, ramping, back, oil, market, still, potentially, hundreds, millions, barrels, excess, oil, inventory, work, Different, scenarios, could, keep, oil, demand, prices, depressed, rest, 2020, potentially, well, 2021, 
The, companies, closest, oil, wells, trouble, West, Texas, Intermediate, crude, futures, fell, 22, April, 9, 40, per, barrel, since, March, 6, Many, U, S, shale, producers, need, oil, consistently, 40, per, barrel, cover, production, costs, start, adding, debt, servicing, corporate, expenses, producers, bleeding, death, environment, nobody, give, infusion, 
We, already, seen, first, U, S, shale, producer, fall, Whiting, Petroleum, NYSE, WLL, filing, Chapter, 11, bankruptcy, protection, beginning, Whiting, reached, agreement, major, holders, debt, filing, result, common, shareholders, losing, 95, stake, company, 
Chesapeake, Energy, looking, like, next, casualty, The, company, reportedly, hired, restructuring, experts, March, mutual, fund, manager, Franklin, Resources, NYSE, BEN, owns, substantial, amount, common, shares, debt, issued, Chesapeake, reportedly, hired, law, firm, assist, negotiations, Chesapeake, could, prove, pre, negotiated, bankruptcy, restructuring, 
There, almost, certainly, independent, oil, producers, run, capital, fall, debt, covenants, downturn, dozens, similar, balance, sheet, operating, profiles, Whiting, Moreover, many, also, lack, liquidity, balance, sheets, cover, even, single, quarter, operating, expenses, much, less, ride, multi, quarter, period, collapsed, demand, costs, oil, prices, 
And, expect, see, bankers, riding, rescue, lifeline, To, contrary, many, banks, large, exposure, U, S, oil, companies, taking, steps, prepare, potentially, taking, control, assets, According, Reuters, report, JPMorgan, Chase, NYSE, JPM, Wells, Fargo, NYSE, WFC, Bank, America, NYSE, BAC, Citigroup, NYSE, C, planning, create, stand, alone, businesses, run, oil, assets, may, seize, looking, get, downturn, instead, offloading, oil, assets, pennies, dollar, current, environment, 
And, oil, producers, risk, Their, struggles, trickle, companies, hire, drill, wells, provide, things, needed, produce, oil, like, well, pipe, drill, bits, frac, sand, hundred, things, Producers, already, calling, suppliers, put, squeeze, lower, costs, ending, contracts, early, 
Looking, oilfields, even, refiners, industry, generally, quite, stable, cash, flow, positive, could, risk, crushing, decline, demand, Refiners, count, steady, demand, keeps, operations, pretty, constant, make, money, 
Even, midstream, companies, pipelines, gathering, systems, storage, facilities, perfectly, insulated, Long, term, contracts, serve, much, good, producer, insolvent, buyer, oil, send, pipeline, We, already, seen, several, midstream, companies, cut, dividends, likely, lot, follow, 
Even, super, majors, immune, devastation, Due, impact, oil, price, collapse, oil, production, segments, ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, gutted, 2020, spending, plans, preserve, capital, largely, aimed, maintaining, dividends, Even, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, produce, oil, cutting, back, capital, investments, refining, marketing, segments, likely, walloped, cratering, demand, 
First, I, expect, money, made, investors, result, oil, crash, There, prove, bargains, benefit, hindsight, know, But, said, I, think, investors, absolutely, nothing, oil, patch, today, The, demand, destruction, right, middle, completely, unprecedented, time, Russia, Saudi, Arabia, United, Arab, Emirates, pumping, oil, Even, U, S, production, starting, slow, still, far, demand, past, couple, weeks, inventory, builds, show, 
The, cheapest, oil, stocks, independent, producers, I, outlined, subsector, minefield, I, expect, lot, bankruptcies, even, best, run, independent, producers, like, Pioneer, Natural, Resources, NYSE, PXD, better, stronger, balance, sheets, liquidity, access, face, toughest, environment, history, It, early, story, know, serious, risks, prove, 
I, expect, supermajors, like, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, make, unscathed, good, enough, shape, Similarly, Phillips, 66, without, production, segment, around, neck, plenty, liquidity, cash, cheap, debt, tap, come, side, fine, condition, But, even, fine, collection, companies, cash, low, cost, debt, could, see, painful, 2020, even, early, 2021, depending, quickly, global, demand, picks, back, deep, flood, crude, still, pouring, markets, turns, long, takes, soak, producers, start, ramping, 
So, supermajors, along, Phillips, 66, likely, prove, fine, investments, buy, hold, downturn, come, close, I, expect, plumbing, depths, 2020, oil, crash, Until, demand, starts, recover, investors, probably, better, keeping, eye, sector, After, still, plenty, bargains, sectors, far, lower, risk, permanent, losses,
