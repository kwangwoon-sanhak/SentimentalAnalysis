That, number, cause, jump, joy, S, P, 500, yields, closer, 2, notably, norm, But, thing, Emerson, yield, high, recent, still, high, end, company, historical, yield, range, What, going, 
For, starters, Emerson, industrial, company, It, something, cyclical, industry, facing, headwinds, today, That, includes, generally, slow, growth, worse, developed, markets, slowing, growth, emerging, markets, notably, China, So, Emerson, expecting, fiscal, 2016, difficult, one, underlying, sales, 2, 5, 
Fiscal, second, quarter, underlying, sales, fell, 5, Despite, many, headwinds, company, earned, 0, 57, share, 
But, thing, Emerson, seen, taking, steps, deal, weak, market, For, starters, company, cutting, costs, Margins, fell, slightly, two, biggest, business, lines, 20, basis, points, process, management, 50, basis, points, industrial, automation, together, 55, top, line, However, climate, technologies, margins, increased, 170, basis, points, commercial, residential, solutions, 380, basis, points, network, power, 490, basis, points, This, trio, basically, represents, rest, sales, 
Emerson, working, hard, keep, core, solid, improve, Interestingly, recent, margin, weakness, process, management, industrial, automation, expected, set, easier, comparisons, later, These, businesses, could, start, look, better, soon, 
Emerson, also, process, spinning, network, power, business, lowest, margin, business, runs, complete, improve, company, overall, operating, margin, In, words, Emerson, may, struggling, little, today, setting, better, tomorrow, collect, nice, dividend, along, way, 
ExxonMobil, increased, annual, dividend, 34, running, impressive, Emerson, streak, pretty, notable, Exxon, one, world, largest, integrated, oil, giants, industry, feeling, little, pain, since, oil, prices, started, fall, mid, 2014, Little, might, understatement, 
Although, better, oil, prices, still, low, historical, standards, That, left, Exxon, results, predictably, weak, How, bad, Earnings, 63, first, quarter, Exxon, sitting, still, though, adjusting, new, environment, 
For, example, capital, spending, first, quarter, 33, That, continues, trend, seen, throughout, industry, And, outcome, Exxon, efforts, pretty, good, The, oil, giant, still, making, money, competitors, bleeding, red, ink, Sure, earnings, nearly, two, thirds, oil, giant, still, made, 0, 43, share, Chevron, comparison, lost, 0, 39, share, first, quarter,

Now, add, two, pieces, puzzle, Exxon, historically, bested, peers, return, invested, capital, arguably, making, one, best, run, oil, majors, And, yield, lower, recent, highs, still, levels, seen, since, turn, century, The, 3, 1, yield, also, notable, edge, S, P, 500, yield, 
The, big, question, whether, Exxon, able, keep, paying, dividend, risk, Right, Exxon, like, peers, tapping, debt, markets, support, growth, spending, shareholder, distributions, But, long, history, dividend, increases, relatively, high, yield, relative, history, still, profitable, business, looks, like, risk, worth, considering, 
Eaton, Corp, harder, sell, dividend, increase, front, annual, streak, seven, long, However, global, industrial, giant, focused, power, management, took, pause, deep, 2007, 2009, recession, It, basically, held, line, dividend, nine, quarters, starting, increase, 
Eaton, dividend, gone, every, long, term, trended, regularly, higher, And, right, yield, nearly, 3, 7, highest, trio, like, others, toward, top, end, company, historical, range, 
Just, like, Emerson, Eaton, hit, weakening, global, economy, It, expecting, organic, revenue, growth, much, 4, But, cost, cutting, past, help, reset, business, better, compete, today, environment, 
For, example, excluding, restructuring, costs, company, operating, margin, first, quarter, improved, around, 30, basis, points, So, using, downturn, strengthen, business, expect, 
It, also, worth, noting, despite, weak, environment, Eaton, also, quite, profitable, It, earned, 0, 88, share, first, quarter, targeting, 4, 15, 4, 45, share, full, Basically, company, looking, flat, earnings, lower, revenues, 
And, share, price, relatively, cheap, buying, back, shares, So, things, like, might, want, collect, reliable, dividend, wait, better, days,
