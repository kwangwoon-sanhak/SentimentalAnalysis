No, company, made, feel, twinge, guilt, harder, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
For, several, I, thought, one, go, stocks, oil, gas, industry, But, typical, everyday, things, life, throws, us, I, able, scrape, together, enough, money, open, position, I, thought, enough, justify, things, like, trading, fees, whatnot, 
Well, I, finally, put, money, mouth, bought, shares, company, I, espoused, virtues, owning, A, little, less, ago, I, pretty, much, laid, reasons, I, thought, stock, compared, peers, I, thought, I, would, share, changes, I, saw, time, influenced, personal, investing, decision, I, hope, help, decision, making, 
What, changed, 
The, obvious, thing, changed, entire, oil, gas, landscape, big, downfall, oil, prices, many, would, expect, hampered, profitability, every, company, produces, oil, gas, ExxonMobil, certainly, immune, changes, seen, held, relatively, well, things, considered, Margins, returns, declined, much, In, fact, EBITDA, margin, 14, 7, 1, 6, percentage, points, lower, time, last, 
The, one, thing, could, really, raise, red, flags, investors, fact, company, free, cash, flow, evaporated, This, past, quarter, first, time, 20, company, seen, levered, free, cash, flow, margin, run, negative, two, consecutive, quarters, 
It, easy, see, could, major, concern, After, reason, shares, ExxonMobil, lucrative, time, returns, ton, free, cash, shareholders, form, dividends, share, repurchases, If, cash, make, value, proposition, ExxonMobil, go, flames, fast, 
If, look, deeper, though, concern, may, slightly, overblown, The, biggest, reason, cash, flow, swing, negative, territory, 7, 5, billion, change, working, capital, Basically, company, reduced, current, liabilities, much, faster, rate, current, assets, By, contrast, two, companies, move, free, cash, flow, positive, territory, past, two, quarters, Royal, Dutch, Shell, BP, saw, working, capital, swing, direction, giving, favorable, cash, position, 
The, reason, I, concerned, decline, free, cash, flow, ExxonMobil, cash, operations, still, exceeds, capital, expenditures, pretty, wide, margin, 5, 5, billion, As, long, still, cranking, cash, operations, excess, capital, expenditures, I, going, fret, much, couple, quarters, negative, free, cash, flow, working, capital, changes, 
What, changed, 
While, jostling, among, five, largest, oil, gas, companies, terms, production, growth, outlooks, margins, ExxonMobil, held, production, guidance, 2017, steady, This, much, surprise, since, much, production, growth, time, period, coming, projects, already, line, ramping, full, capacity, ones, began, construction, ago, going, shut, today, drop, oil, prices, The, one, small, interesting, caveat, company, still, plans, growing, one, segment, could, curtailed, rather, quickly, U, S, shale, oil,

It, take, pretty, monumental, effort, another, one, companies, make, leap, ExxonMobil, regard, One, could, argue, oil, prices, would, help, keep, mind, gain, one, companies, experiences, oil, gas, prices, four, certain, degree, 
What, even, surprising, return, equity, numbers, companies, listed, ExxonMobil, lowest, amount, debt, percentage, capital, structure, Typically, company, juices, debt, crank, slightly, better, returns, equity, But, ExxonMobil, turned, traditional, thinking, head, repurchased, retired, many, shares, drastically, reduced, book, value, company, equity, 
As, long, company, continue, generate, best, class, returns, still, cash, operations, left, capital, expenditures, I, still, see, ExxonMobil, best, pick, among, big, oil, giants, 
Why, 
Several, ago, whole, lot, get, excited, looking, valuation, ExxonMobil, integrated, major, stock, look, traditional, valuation, metrics, price, earnings, see, huge, change, several, ago, Actually, using, income, statement, valuation, method, ExxonMobil, shares, actually, trade, slight, premium, average, valuation, past, 10, 
The, metric, stands, today, though, possibly, one, given, attention, price, tangible, book, value, The, issue, using, income, statement, valuations, like, price, earnings, price, sales, company, commodities, almost, entirely, reflection, commodity, prices, indicative, value, underlying, assets, owned, company, whereas, price, tangible, book, value, reflective, value, company, assets, generate, sales, earnings, matter, price, environment, 
Today, ExxonMobil, trades, 2, 03, times, tangible, book, value, decent, discount, 10, average, valuation, 2, 9, times, tangible, book, Also, keep, mind, ExxonMobil, tangible, book, value, slightly, artificially, inflated, repurchased, shares, lower, book, value, equity,

What, Fool, believes, 
Admittedly, small, part, reason, I, bought, stock, slight, aversion, making, recommendations, stocks, I, However, driving, factor, purchase, I, really, like, stock, I, wanted, make, part, portfolio, 
While, decline, oil, prices, put, pretty, good, dent, earnings, power, ExxonMobil, time, really, made, structural, changes, company, After, talking, company, around, hundred, gone, major, ups, downs, commodity, cycle, I, investing, money, thinking, able, emerge, downward, price, cycle, great, position, profit, done, many, times,
