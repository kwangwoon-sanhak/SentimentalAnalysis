Upstream, business, segments, provide, higher, margins, commodity, prices, high, also, fuel, downstream, business, segments, Downstream, business, segments, include, processing, facilities, plastics, plants, refineries, These, investments, provide, steady, stream, cash, flow, helps, soften, blow, price, crude, oil, feeds, gets, volatile, 
In, 2013, price, oil, coasting, 100, per, barrel, gettin, good, unusual, see, companies, take, huge, sums, debt, dive, headfirst, upstream, market, When, oil, prices, plummeted, 2016, decisions, led, lot, non, integrated, solely, upstream, companies, go, bankrupt, seemingly, overnight, 
Production, costs, vary, upstream, industry, investors, generally, assume, higher, price, per, barrel, oil, profits, upstream, producer, make, The, said, downstream, industry, While, downstream, assets, also, exposed, commodity, price, volatility, companies, welcome, lower, input, costs, downstream, level, provided, demand, finished, products, stays, level, Level, increased, demand, finished, downstream, products, would, allow, producers, enjoy, steady, pricing, power, In, perfect, world, refineries, would, want, cheaper, crude, oil, basically, lowers, cost, primary, inputs, 
Downstream, assets, refineries, plastics, plants, LNG, facilities, require, decades, long, investment, commitment, reliably, produce, similar, margins, throughout, life, asset, Downstream, processing, facilities, refineries, deliver, reliable, revenue, streams, margins, sell, customers, long, term, contracts, capacity, refine, oil, 
Upstream, companies, merely, find, refineries, sell, oil, every, well, tapped, much, quicker, process, This, make, cycle, investment, projects, less, meaning, contracts, sell, oil, refineries, come, renewal, real, quick, And, contracts, come, renewal, oil, prices, low, maybe, even, costs, get, oil, ground, upstream, producers, may, rethink, renewing, contract, suck, take, hit, production, keep, going, make, amount, revenue, Sometimes, something, better, nothing, even, operating, loss, 
To, understand, diversified, ExxonMobil, upstream, downstream, businesses, helps, understand, much, company, revenue, attributable, upstream, downstream, assets, This, also, helps, understand, much, company, revenue, exposed, fluctuations, commodity, prices, 
In, 2013, oil, trading, 100, per, barrel, scant, 9, 3, ExxonMobil, revenue, came, upstream, business, Downstream, revenue, made, 81, 4, ExxonMobil, revenue, The, remainder, attributable, company, chemical, segment, 
In, recent, annual, earnings, release, Exxon, attributed, 9, 1, total, revenue, upstream, operations, revenue, downstream, operations, made, 80, 2, total, revenue, quarter, 
These, similarities, proportions, revenue, suggest, Exxon, kept, asset, mix, upstream, downstream, somewhat, level, throughout, time, span, Exxon, either, thoughtfully, maintains, asset, mix, wants, keep, diversification, target, level, needs, produce, general, proportion, crude, oil, order, keep, refineries, running, levels, wants, 
To, figure, Exxon, revenue, split, compares, typical, energy, industry, helps, look, companies, similarly, include, downstream, upstream, revenue, generating, assets, BP, NYSE, BP, Shell, Oil, NYSE, RDS, B, NYSE, RDS, A, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, sizable, stake, downstream, upstream, assets, differs, proportions, revenue, segments, produce, 
This, table, shows, company, upstream, downstream, revenue, percentage, revenue, 2019, To, make, proportions, accurate, leaving, revenue, company, gained, sales, business, units, And, numbers, add, 100, remember, also, overlooking, company, chemical, operations, 
Of, four, companies, Exxon, second, least, exposed, upstream, price, volatility, gives, strong, footing, outlast, depressions, commodity, prices, upstream, segment, 
Reviewing, company, income, stream, comes, high, investor, list, researching, investment, For, integrated, oil, producers, breakdown, upstream, downstream, may, also, give, indication, risks, company, taking, investors, capital, And, case, investors, value, well, diversified, asset, base, limited, exposure, volatility, commodity, prices, may, find, Exxon, right, bet,
