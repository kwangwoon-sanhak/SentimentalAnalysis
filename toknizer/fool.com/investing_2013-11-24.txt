Is, something, similar, suspected, Exxon, 
The, question, Fools, need, ask, What, exactly, Buffett, mind, acquired, stake, ExxonMobil, last, week, Is, something, similar, expected, Exxon, Let, explore, 
This, ConocoPhillips, performed, since, Buffett, acquired, stake, early, 2006, 
COP, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
And, Phillips, 66, performed, since, spun, independent, refiner, 
PSX, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Integrated, basics, 
As, integrated, oil, company, exploration, production, refining, transportation, marketing, divisions, housed, together, single, entity, In, many, ways, integrated, structure, one, efficient, ways, business, producing, selling, oil, gas, In, fact, structure, 1870s, John, D, Rockefeller, Standard, Oil, started, consolidating, refining, business, buying, pipelines, oil, transportation, Eventually, 1890, Standard, Oil, extended, business, exploration, production, In, words, eminent, oil, historian, Daniel, Yergin, Rockefeller, created, vertically, integrated, petroleum, company, 
For, century, integrated, structure, oil, gas, companies, arguably, among, profitable, undertakings, industry, It, surprise, hugely, successful, Standard, Oil, broken, 1911, increasingly, monopolistic, hold, within, industry, The, seven, successor, companies, evolved, various, mergers, acquisitions, highly, profitable, Among, ExxonMobil, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Conoco, merger, Phillips, form, ConocoPhillips, American, arm, BP, NYSE, BP, In, short, integrated, structure, served, oil, gas, business, extremely, well, 
Why, structure, successful, 
One, biggest, reasons, corporations, preferred, integrated, structure, efficiency, brought, Since, discovery, 1850s, oil, subject, various, demand, supply, shocks, saw, various, bubbles, formed, different, periods, time, The, integrated, structure, hand, brought, much, required, stability, business, corporations, really, depend, third, parties, buy, sell, oil, Instead, could, extract, black, gold, properties, transport, via, pipelines, held, majority, stakes, refine, various, products, refineries, market, brands, 
Initially, entire, operations, took, place, within, United, States, However, corporations, started, building, deeper, cash, reserves, operations, began, expand, around, globe, especially, exploration, production, Huge, legacy, assets, ensured, easy, access, large, reserves, oil, served, companies, decades, 
The, game, changer, 
However, past, 10, global, energy, demand, took, sharp, turn, north, emerging, countries, started, developing, dramatic, pace, unseen, till, Naturally, oil, prices, shot, Eventually, became, clear, easy, oil, production, longer, sustain, ever, increasing, global, demand, oil, gas, 
Reserves, considered, uneconomical, produce, started, becoming, serious, business, prospects, Higher, crude, oil, prices, afforded, expensive, game, changing, technology, employed, order, extract, resources, considered, difficult, unviable, In, short, exploration, production, business, became, even, highly, specialized, past, five, 
The, word, unconventional, 
The, discovery, shale, oil, tight, oil, reserves, U, S, well, ultra, deep, sea, reserves, around, globe, saw, limelight, shifting, unconventional, production, oil, natural, gas, Independent, oil, producers, EOG, Resources, NYSE, EOG, Kodiak, Oil, Gas, NYSE, KOG, early, movers, unconventional, scene, amassed, properties, cheaply, Eagle, Ford, Bakken, shale, plays, Even, ConocoPhillips, moved, fast, acquiring, shale, oil, rich, properties, 
Unfortunately, integrated, companies, nimble, Their, overdependence, legacy, assets, around, globe, turned, burdensome, long, run, Gradually, needed, pump, money, ensure, stable, production, levels, fields, They, slow, making, transition, staying, abreast, changing, industry, trends, 
As, complexity, operations, increased, cost, production, soared, companies, realized, one, way, keep, check, expenses, increase, operational, efficiency, focusing, solely, core, competencies, As, result, smaller, independent, producers, EOG, Resources, Kodiak, flexible, making, quick, turnarounds, production, profiles, 800, pound, gorillas, industry, 
Will, Exxon, divest, refining, arm, 
The, big, question, Will, ExxonMobil, divest, refining, arm, The, company, underperformed, broader, markets, last, Despite, increase, production, last, earnings, slipped, thanks, disastrous, refining, margins, thus, bringing, question, integrated, model, Growth, issue, Here, Exxon, total, returns, compare, S, P, 500, past, five, 
XOM, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Traditionally, Exxon, good, allocator, capital, impressive, returns, probably, caught, Buffett, attention, first, place, However, growth, looks, limited, point, unless, spinoff, cards, I, see, markets, otherwise, undervaluing, excellent, company, 
Getting, gassy, exploring, new, frontiers, 
Through, acquisition, XTO, Energy, 2009, Exxon, natural, gas, making, 49, total, reserves, While, natural, gas, may, garner, lot, attention, market, short, run, global, demand, commodity, huge, long, run, Exxon, also, involved, ultra, deepwater, exploration, activities, But, remains, seen, profitable, 
Despite, impressive, lineup, projects, execution, major, ones, seems, unmistakable, slow, Fellow, Fool, Tyler, Crowe, points, 30, billion, Kashagan, project, seven, late, 300, budget, The, 4, 1, billion, Kearl, Oil, Sands, project, late, 61, budget, Papua, New, Guinea, LNG, project, 21, budget, 
Final, thoughts, 
The, signs, ominous, ExxonMobil, could, break, Or, may, choose, stay, But, definitely, spinoff, sort, unlock, hidden, value, upstream, downstream, divisions, Warren, Buffett, already, seen, one, divestiture, holding, ConocoPhillips, The, question, Is, sensing, something, similar, take, place, Exxon, The, time, seems, ripe, The, integrated, model, seems, dying, Long, live, integrated, model,
