ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, recently, raised, 12, billion, cash, debt, sale, need, either, dividend, payments, organic, growth, purposes, To, wit, ExxonMobil, made, 2, 8, billion, profits, fourth, quarter, 16, 2, billion, 2015, With, ExxonMobil, 8, billion, planned, capital, expenditures, cuts, 2016, company, free, cash, flow, enough, cover, 12, 1, billion, annual, dividend, 
Many, analysts, think, ExxonMobil, raised, money, acquisitions, Given, cheap, valuations, energy, sector, ExxonMobil, could, use, acquisitions, build, reserves, increase, production, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, BG, Group, acquisition, The, difference, course, ExxonMobil, probably, purchase, reserves, production, discount, Shell, energy, prices, substantially, lower, Following, three, companies, ExxonMobil, could, potentially, target, 
1, An, energy, company, Texas, sized, reserve, potential, 
With, enterprise, value, 47, billion, EOG, Resources, NYSE, EOG, little, bit, bite, sized, even, giant, ExxonMobil, Given, acquiring, company, would, pay, premium, get, deal, done, ExxonMobil, would, probably, bid, 55, billion, 65, billion, acquire, EOG, Resources, outright, meaning, ExxonMobil, would, either, raise, debt, potentially, lose, AAA, credit, rating, finance, deal, equity, dilute, shareholders, 
Given, EOG, Resources, massive, reserves, however, might, worth, According, financial, reports, company, total, resource, potential, almost, 7, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, spread, across, 1, 3, million, net, acres, several, promising, basins, including, Eagle, Ford, Bakken, Delaware, Basins, If, shale, technology, improves, total, resource, potential, number, probably, increase, 
SOURCE, EOG, INVESTOR, RELATIONS, 
More, crucially, EOG, Resources, low, cost, production, Research, firm, PIRA, estimates, EOG, breakeven, oil, price, 30, per, barrel, versus, U, S, tight, oil, general, breakeven, 40, 65, per, barrel, If, ExxonMobil, purchase, EOG, would, instantly, add, billions, low, cost, potential, reserves, increase, production, around, half, million, BOE, per, day, 
2, An, independent, major, presence, Permian, 
Pioneer, Natural, Resources, NYSE, PXD, major, presence, Permian, basin, tens, billions, BOE, resource, potential, surprisingly, competitive, sub, 50, per, barrel, WTI, prices, According, statistics, Energy, Information, Administration, oil, production, Permian, basin, held, steady, risen, even, production, basins, Eagle, Ford, Bakken, declined, 
An, ExxonMobil, purchase, Pioneer, would, give, company, 800, 000, gross, acres, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, shale, basin, 664, million, barrels, proved, oil, equivalent, billions, potential, oil, equivalent, roughly, 224, 000, BOE, production, day, Although, 664, million, barrels, proven, oil, equivalent, sound, like, much, company, ExxonMobil, size, Exxon, added, 1, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, proved, reserves, 2015, alone, Pioneer, proven, reserves, growing, quickly, In, 2015, Pioneer, added, 210, million, barrels, proven, oil, equivalent, despite, sharp, drop, energy, prices, 
3, The, dominant, company, Bakken, 
Continental, Resources, NYSE, CLR, dominant, producer, Bakken, 1, 045, million, net, acres, basin, Although, production, Bakken, generally, expensive, production, Eagle, Ford, Permian, wider, price, differentials, resulting, limited, pipeline, capacity, tougher, geography, Continental, Resources, also, substantially, cheaper, peers, Continental, enterprise, value, 18, 5, billion, versus, Pioneer, enterprise, value, 25, billion, even, though, Continental, almost, twice, amount, proven, reserves, 1, 226, billion, BOE, end, 2015, roughly, amount, production, around, 200, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, If, crude, prices, rise, past, 60, 70, per, barrel, acquisition, Continental, Resources, would, make, great, sense, company, would, grow, production, healthy, rate, organically, profitable, 
How, ExxonMobil, benefits, potential, acquisitions, 
Although, danger, running, given, total, proven, reserves, 24, 8, billion, BOE, ExxonMobil, replaced, 67, production, last, 115, average, past, 10, An, acquisition, EOG, Pioneer, Continental, would, help, bridge, ExxonMobil, replacement, gap, several, would, give, company, low, capital, intensity, short, lead, time, method, increase, production, With, unparalleled, scale, low, cost, capital, ExxonMobil, could, realize, return, every, barrel, oil, gas, produces, potential, acquisition, could, pay, substantially, crude, prices, rebound,
