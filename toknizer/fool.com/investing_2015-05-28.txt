ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, one, better, oil, dividend, investments, make, enormous, scale, diversified, business, model, However, three, risk, factors, I, think, investors, need, aware, Risks, could, negatively, affect, future, returns, include, expensive, race, production, declines, exposure, geopolitical, risks, oil, crash, effects, future, buybacks, dividend, growth, 
Exxon, production, decline, treadmill, 
All, oil, companies, face, prospects, naturally, declining, production, Exxon, estimates, around, 3, coming, invest, heavily, new, production, projects, 
To, fair, oil, crash, increased, company, efforts, maximize, production, cheaply, possible, For, instance, Exxon, thinks, bring, 16, major, projects, online, 2017, allow, increase, production, 2, 2015, 3, 2016, 2017, cutting, capital, spending, 12, 5, 34, billion, per, next, three, 
However, investors, aware, oil, projects, complicated, often, run, budget, For, example, Exxon, Kipper, gas, joint, venture, Australia, ended, running, 63, budget, In, first, quarter, company, able, cut, capital, spending, 9, capital, spending, reduction, guidance, target, possibly, indicating, recent, projects, also, coming, budget, 
Growth, plans, could, derailed, politics, war, 
Exxon, explores, produces, oil, world, including, politically, unstable, areas, expose, political, risk, cost, billions, lost, investment, 
For, instance, 2007, Venezuela, nationalized, certain, oil, assets, specifically, Exxon, 41, 67, interest, Cerro, Negro, Heavy, Oil, Project, government, attempted, change, terms, previous, agreements, Exxon, refused, play, ball, Exxon, took, issue, International, Center, Settlement, Investment, Disputes, awarded, 1, 6, billion, judgment, June, 27, 2007, However, Venezuelan, government, able, avoid, paying, throwing, appeal, appeal, day, Exxon, yet, see, dime, 
A, potentially, bigger, hit, future, growth, prospects, comes, impositions, Western, sanctions, Russia, forced, Exxon, halt, drilling, major, offshore, Arctic, Ocean, joint, venture, Russian, oil, giant, Rosneft, last, Rosneft, recently, indicated, ready, restart, offshore, drilling, Arctic, may, choose, alternative, global, partners, 
That, 2011, Exxon, signed, major, deal, Rosneft, covers, 63, 6, million, acres, worth, drilling, rights, Kara, Laptev, Chukchi, Black, seas, The, U, S, Geological, Survey, estimates, Arctic, contains, oil, equivalent, 413, billion, barrels, oil, gas, Vladimir, Putin, stated, Exxon, Rosneft, deal, could, eventually, provide, much, 500, billion, future, investment, opportunities, 
Tensions, West, Russia, growing, Russia, actions, Ukraine, Exxon, stated, honor, sanctions, forbid, oil, related, investment, Thus, however, long, geopolitical, crisis, Ukraine, continues, Exxon, stands, lose, potentially, billions, future, profits, cash, flow, opportunities, 
Shareholder, cash, returns, dependent, volatile, free, cash, flows, 
Giant, oil, companies, Exxon, really, grow, production, fast, rate, given, volatility, crude, prices, consistent, way, grow, long, term, earnings, free, cash, flow, per, share, pays, dividends, buybacks, reducing, share, count, aggressive, share, count, reductions, 
Analysts, Barclays, estimate, dollar, per, barrel, decline, oil, prices, represents, 280, million, hit, Exxon, annual, operating, cash, flows, However, enormous, overhead, costs, constructing, maintaining, growing, production, effects, Exxon, free, cash, flows, even, stronger, 
In, first, quarter, Exxon, free, cash, flow, rang, 1, 15, billion, 85, compared, Q1, 2014, This, drop, forced, management, reduce, share, buybacks, 54, guide, 67, reduction, buybacks, second, quarter, 2015, 
Takeaway, Exxon, among, safest, oil, majors, even, bulletproof, 
Don, get, wrong, As, far, big, oil, companies, go, Exxon, among, best, choices, make, track, record, consistent, buybacks, dividend, growth, market, beating, returns, However, investors, need, aware, even, mighty, Exxon, impervious, major, risks, future, earnings, cash, flows, dividend, growth, prospects,
