Both, numbers, lower, prior, week, build, EIA, estimated, 9, 0, million, barrels, API, estimated, 10, 0, million, barrels, oversupply, remains, concern, 
The, falling, oil, prices, dragged, oil, stocks, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, Shares, two, oil, giants, 1, 5, morning, trading, 
In, recent, become, difficult, find, high, quality, stocks, dividend, yields, 5, Simply, put, 10, bull, market, driven, valuations, good, companies, higher, yield, price, inverse, relationship, 
While, COVID, 19, pandemic, terrible, situation, U, S, economy, created, opportunities, long, term, investors, especially, want, dividend, paying, stocks, With, mind, yield, seekers, take, closer, look, Realty, Income, NYSE, O, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Wells, Fargo, NYSE, WFC, 
I, called, net, lease, real, estate, investment, trust, Realty, Income, best, around, dividend, stock, market, company, first, quarter, earnings, report, illustrates, The, company, owns, primarily, single, tenant, retail, real, estate, reported, 7, 3, growth, funds, operations, REIT, version, earnings, continues, make, new, investments, grow, portfolio, 
Here, impressive, part, While, many, peers, retail, real, estate, space, struggling, Realty, Income, relatively, well, Eighty, three, percent, tenants, paid, April, rent, occupancy, stands, 98, 5, Of, 17, April, rent, yet, collected, tenants, rent, deferral, discussions, company, And, Realty, Income, 2, billion, cash, credit, availability, well, positioned, absorb, short, term, impact, COVID, 19, pandemic, 
Realty, Income, increased, dividend, 90, consecutive, quarters, including, March, 2020, delivered, annualized, total, return, 14, 6, since, 1994, NYSE, listing, With, 5, 3, yield, stock, still, 38, lower, February, high, Realty, Income, could, fantastic, addition, dividend, investor, portfolio, 
Many, investors, hesitant, invest, oil, stocks, easy, understand, After, watching, oil, futures, actually, turn, negative, brief, time, April, price, oil, still, levels, make, unprofitable, produce, American, companies, many, people, simply, wait, see, mode, 
However, could, excellent, time, add, high, quality, oil, stock, like, ExxonMobil, portfolio, especially, long, investing, time, frame, For, one, thing, Exxon, massive, diversified, business, operations, refining, pipelines, chemical, manufacturing, While, things, like, drilling, suffering, parts, business, refining, actually, benefit, lower, prices, And, company, cut, capital, spending, operating, expenses, dramatically, help, cushion, blow, falling, oil, prices, 
With, 7, 6, yield, management, said, dividend, maintained, stock, price, 40, 52, week, high, ExxonMobil, top, notch, oil, company, looks, like, compelling, long, term, bargain, 
The, financial, sector, one, worst, performing, parts, stock, market, COVID, 19, pandemic, Wells, Fargo, hit, harder, Not, Wells, Fargo, dramatically, underperformed, big, bank, stock, peers, recent, due, numerous, scandals, penalties, lost, nearly, half, value, 2020, alone, 
There, good, reason, recent, underperformance, While, big, banks, investment, banking, divisions, well, volatile, environments, Wells, Fargo, purely, commercial, bank, The, vast, majority, business, comes, providing, everyday, banking, services, individuals, businesses, And, commercial, banking, lot, question, marks, right, pandemic, causes, deep, recession, Americans, could, trouble, paying, bills, loan, defaults, could, spike, Plus, record, low, interest, rates, exactly, ideal, environment, banks, profit, 
However, Wells, Fargo, well, capitalized, institution, generally, strong, asset, quality, The, stock, trades, 31, less, book, value, yields, 7, 5, With, new, CEO, helm, massive, discount, Wells, Fargo, could, best, long, term, value, banking, industry, 
As, final, point, I, think, stable, dividend, investments, long, term, perspective, important, keep, mind, coronavirus, outbreak, still, far, unprecedented, rapidly, evolving, situation, If, get, bad, virus, related, news, looks, like, economic, shutdown, impact, expected, could, certainly, fall, near, term, In, nutshell, buy, potential, five, 10, 20, expect, roller, coaster, ride, time, 
The, past, 10, weeks, unlike, anything, Wall, Street, retail, investors, ever, witnessed, The, proliferation, coronavirus, disease, 2019, COVID, 19, within, U, S, around, globe, led, record, levels, volatility, stock, market, neck, breaking, moves, major, U, S, indexes, In, fact, saw, benchmark, S, P, 500, push, bear, market, territory, quicker, pace, previous, correction, history, 
However, major, downdrafts, stock, market, always, proved, advantageous, opportunities, put, capital, work, That, corrections, bear, markets, eventually, put, rearview, mirror, bull, market, rallies, As, long, buy, great, companies, give, investment, theses, businesses, ample, time, proved, true, good, chance, growing, wealth, 
The, thing, need, millionaire, make, money, stock, market, If, even, 2, 000, set, aside, need, pay, bills, emergencies, following, three, stocks, could, smartest, buys, make, 
Pretty, much, companies, financial, sector, cyclical, means, going, feel, sort, pinch, likely, recession, pushed, COVID, 19, Credit, services, giant, Visa, NYSE, V, different, see, dollar, amount, transacted, network, decline, greater, number, Americans, laid, 
However, Visa, shown, time, built, survive, often, relatively, short, downward, moves, stock, market, U, S, economy, This, company, currently, holds, half, U, S, credit, card, market, share, network, purchase, volume, enviable, position, considering, 70, U, S, GDP, based, consumption, With, understanding, U, S, economy, spends, far, time, expanding, contracting, Visa, come, pandemic, fine, 
What, Visa, focuses, solely, processing, side, equation, Because, direct, lender, Visa, hurt, rising, loan, delinquencies, typically, accompany, follow, recession, This, allows, Visa, rebound, much, faster, credit, service, peers, ensures, profit, margin, 52, trailing, 12, period, remains, superior, 
Even, though, I, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, shareholder, I, admit, far, sexy, pick, We, witnessed, disruption, oil, market, like, never, going, time, supply, demand, brought, back, form, harmony, This, makes, profitability, virtually, impossible, near, term, oil, stocks, 
Yet, longer, run, ExxonMobil, well, positioned, thrive, Remember, integrated, oil, giant, solely, dependent, drilling, exploration, Don, get, wrong, drilling, offers, company, greatest, growth, prospects, Nothing, would, please, seeing, Payara, Project, 220, 000, barrels, per, day, production, get, ground, mid, decade, But, company, plenty, cash, flow, potential, downstream, operations, refining, petrochemical, operations, ExxonMobil, expected, lean, downstream, segment, benefit, weaker, crude, prices, foreseeable, future, 
Exxon, also, luxury, cutting, back, capital, expenditures, control, cash, outflows, period, unprecedented, demand, weakness, Recently, company, cut, 10, billion, capital, expenditure, forecast, 2020, 30, billion, 33, billion, The, plan, keep, dividend, intact, company, save, cash, big, time, ever, needs, dial, back, payout, 
In, words, ExxonMobil, going, fine, 
Investors, 2, 000, spare, cash, would, also, smart, load, shares, pharma, company, Bristol, Myers, Squibb, NYSE, BMY, Its, shares, outperformed, broad, based, S, P, 500, 2020, albeit, still, 6, past, weekend, 
While, obvious, concerns, clinical, research, could, disrupted, COVID, 19, pandemic, healthcare, stocks, remain, one, defensive, categories, throughout, mess, Because, people, get, luxury, choosing, get, sick, ailment, develop, demand, pharmaceuticals, tends, remain, consistent, one, next, This, leads, predictable, cash, flow, Bristol, Myers, time, little, seems, predictable, 
Perhaps, biggest, tailwind, company, recently, completed, acquisition, Celgene, Revlimid, Celgene, blockbuster, multiple, myeloma, drug, may, shot, 12, billion, plus, annual, sales, 2020, revenue, stream, protected, flood, generic, competition, end, January, 2026, That, lot, cash, flow, headed, Bristol, Myers, way, 
Furthermore, company, cancer, immunotherapy, Opdivo, tested, dozens, clinical, trials, primarily, combination, therapy, We, talking, drug, already, generating, 7, billion, annually, sales, could, easily, move, past, 10, billion, per, mark, continues, expand, label, 
At, 8, times, next, forecast, profit, Bristol, Myers, Squibb, looks, like, screaming, buy, 
Before, consider, Bristol, Myers, Squibb, Company, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Bristol, Myers, Squibb, Company, one,
