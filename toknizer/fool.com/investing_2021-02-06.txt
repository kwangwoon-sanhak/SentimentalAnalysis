The, energy, industry, often, defined, big, sweeping, trends, shape, companies, In, early, 20th, century, biggest, trends, growth, oil, transportation, fuel, coal, fuel, electricity, consumption, 
In, past, two, decades, coal, shoved, aside, natural, gas, renewable, energy, power, plants, cost, effective, cleaner, Transportation, markets, likely, next, electric, vehicles, EVs, offered, nearly, every, manufacturer, industry, 
The, success, Tesla, shown, demand, EVs, strong, market, still, young, disrupted, oil, stocks, much, yet, But, big, moves, like, General, Motors, NYSE, GM, commitment, build, nothing, electric, vehicles, 2035, help, push, world, beyond, oil, Investors, prepare, portfolios, 
EVs, slowly, gaining, ground, current, scale, makes, troubling, oil, markets, According, U, S, Department, Energy, 17, 763, plug, EVs, sold, 2011, barely, enough, effect, auto, market, But, number, increased, 326, 644, 2019, That, annual, growth, rate, 44, market, share, increase, 0, 1, 1, 9, approximately, 17, million, vehicles, sold, 
If, 44, growth, continues, U, S, EVs, replace, gasoline, powered, vehicles, decade, The, transition, away, gasoline, powered, vehicles, likely, happen, quickly, GM, commitment, shows, see, future, internal, combustion, vehicles, And, upstarts, like, Fisker, Rivian, Nikola, many, others, hitting, market, next, extremely, compelling, offerings, future, gasoline, powered, vehicles, look, good, 
If, EVs, take, market, share, auto, industry, would, make, sense, oil, consumption, slowly, fall, And, good, news, given, trends, taking, shape, oil, markets, 
The, chart, shows, seen, slowdown, decline, oil, consumption, growth, The, chart, shows, decline, oil, demand, past, decade, although, trend, toward, fuel, efficiency, vehicles, 2005, 2015, oil, prices, high, replaced, surge, truck, SUV, sales, back, strong, economy, low, oil, prices, But, see, course, 15, U, S, demand, already, showing, signs, declining, even, much, impact, electric, vehicles,
