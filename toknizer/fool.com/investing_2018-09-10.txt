For, quarterly, conference, call, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, revealing, Bill, Belichick, postgame, press, conference, Investors, gave, management, quite, bit, slack, tight, lipped, past, company, put, rates, return, well, ahead, peers, 
Recently, though, production, slides, eroding, rates, return, led, investors, clamoring, transparency, So, past, quarter, ExxonMobil, started, open, bringing, executives, explain, goings, company, field, analyst, questions, quarterly, conference, call, 
Here, things, learned, new, open, ExxonMobil, investors, take, away, conference, call, 
For, past, many, investors, Wall, Street, analysts, become, increasingly, concerned, Exxon, production, numbers, steadily, declining, Fortunately, increasing, oil, prices, results, refining, chemical, segment, helped, increase, earnings, despite, lower, production, volumes, But, large, part, reason, Exxon, earnings, results, recovered, quickly, others, business, company, best, class, returns, investment, fallen, line, peers, 
According, Senior, Vice, President, Neil, Chapman, executive, recent, call, things, start, improve, This, quarter, low, point, terms, volumes, upstream, downstream, Absent, unknown, extraordinary, event, volumes, steadily, increase, second, half, 
Chapman, said, 2018, production, less, flat, compared, prior, Some, gains, come, bringing, back, line, assets, hurt, unplanned, events, earthquake, near, Papua, LNG, facility, fire, Syncrude, oil, sands, facility, Canada, And, growth, driver, early, part, recovery, shale, oil, drilling, Permian, Basin, 
As, weird, sounds, ExxonMobil, production, decline, past, deliberate, As, Chapman, mentioned, declines, product, poor, operational, performance, capital, allocation, decision, 
As, I, commented, previously, volumes, equal, There, range, profitability, volumes, produce, Our, focus, value, continue, upgrade, mix, strengthen, portfolio, In, words, structural, change, upstream, business, perspective, I, provided, March, 
Some, places, drilling, shale, natural, gas, U, S, producing, returns, management, desired, enough, downstream, assets, like, chemical, manufacturing, take, advantage, cheap, feedstock, So, rather, keep, producing, sake, producing, wound, operations, U, S, shale, gas, spend, money, places, like, lucrative, offshore, discoveries, near, Guyana, 
Speaking, Guyana, offshore, discovery, management, fast, tracked, development, From, discovery, first, oil, going, around, five, offshore, equivalent, going, ludicrous, speed, It, seems, every, quarter, company, news, additional, discovery, resource, estimate, increase, new, plan, pump, oil, prospective, block, This, past, quarter, different, Chapman, updated, us, Guyana, 
Estimated, gross, resources, block, pending, assessment, latest, discoveries, 4, billion, oil, equivalent, barrels, 3, 2, billion, I, communicated, March, four, ago, We, made, eighth, discovery, block, Longtail, exploration, well, encountered, 256, feet, high, quality, oil, bearing, sandstone, establishes, Turbot, area, potential, hub, 500, million, oil, equivalent, barrels, recoverable, 
We, currently, making, plans, second, exploration, vessel, offshore, Guyana, bringing, total, number, drillships, Staebroek, block, three, The, new, vessel, planned, operate, parallel, Stena, Carron, explore, block, numerous, high, value, additional, prospects, The, collective, discoveries, block, established, potential, five, FPSOs, floating, production, storage, offloading, vessels, producing, 750, 000, barrels, per, day, 2025, potential, additional, production, significant, number, undrilled, targets, plans, rapid, exploration, appraisal, drilling, You, may, remember, March, meeting, I, outlining, three, FPSOs, plan, looking, production, level, 500, 000, barrels, per, day, significant, increase, 
By, 2025, ExxonMobil, targeting, production, rates, 5, million, barrels, per, day, It, already, made, case, production, Permian, Basin, shale, 750, 000, barrels, per, day, addition, Guyana, 750, 000, barrels, per, day, would, mean, two, assets, could, represent, much, 30, production, 
One, reasons, many, ExxonMobil, peers, seeing, significant, increases, earnings, cash, flow, lately, gone, could, call, harvest, resources, Basically, brought, significant, portion, projects, service, recently, winding, capital, spending, reap, benefits, labors, 
Exxon, hand, spending, heavily, compared, peers, earlier, stage, projects, exploration, new, resources, Chapman, explained, call, 
If, invest, upstream, If, invest, going, get, 6, decline, across, business, So, important, invest, adding, capacity, adding, quality, capacity, I, know, ask, competitors, investing, new, projects, All, I, tell, good, projects, best, since, merger, And, I, wanted, wanted, CEO, Darren, Woods, wanted, us, transparent, investment, community, projects, transparent, terms, investing, 
Finding, oil, exploration, guaranteed, recently, lot, successful, exploration, finds, Exxon, thinks, staying, ahead, competition, green, lighting, exploration, work, Whether, strategy, pays, likely, take, determine, But, strategy, ExxonMobil, employed, made, one, successful, oil, companies, decades, 
Natural, gas, companies, produced, record, 3, 68, trillion, cubic, meters, 130, trillion, cubic, feet, natural, gas, last, according, BP, NYSE, BP, Statistical, Review, World, Energy, That, increase, 4, prior, almost, double, 10, average, growth, rate, thanks, big, uptick, production, Russia, contributed, third, global, growth, North, America, however, largest, gas, producing, region, led, U, S, provided, 20, global, supply, followed, Russia, 17, 3, Iran, 6, 1, Canada, Qatar, round, top, five, 4, 8, 
Fueling, continued, growth, natural, gas, market, demand, Countries, like, China, U, S, replacing, coal, fired, power, plants, cleaner, burning, gas, plants, Meanwhile, Japan, due, Fukushima, disaster, 2011, South, Korea, shifted, away, nuclear, power, natural, gas, recent, On, top, shift, toward, gas, power, industry, growing, global, economy, continues, fuel, demand, petrochemical, products, produced, natural, gas, All, factors, suggest, natural, gas, remain, essential, fuel, future, investors, take, notice, industry, 
This, growing, demand, leads, International, Energy, Agency, forecast, global, natural, gas, market, expand, 45, 2040, That, puts, gas, right, renewable, energy, increased, energy, efficiency, one, three, main, factors, help, world, meet, energy, needs, next, two, decades,
