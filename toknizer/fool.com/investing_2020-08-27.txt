Shares, integrated, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, nosedived, 2020, oil, prices, plunged, historic, lows, With, stock, set, booted, Dow, 30, end, era, investing, opportunity, willing, step, others, fearful, Here, look, key, risks, understand, making, final, call, oil, company, 
Let, get, biggest, potential, risk, way, front, An, Exxon, bankruptcy, highly, unlikely, near, term, As, stands, company, one, strongest, balance, sheets, integrated, peers, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, 0, 38, times, Although, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 0, 25, times, lower, European, players, much, higher, debt, equity, ratios, At, top, end, BP, around, 1, 1, times, The, truth, 0, 38, times, actually, fairly, reasonable, number, leaving, Exxon, ample, room, balance, sheet, handle, adversity, 
Bankruptcy, however, worst, case, scenario, There, lot, things, besides, Exxon, going, belly, go, wrong, investors, 
Exxon, increased, dividend, three, decades, During, Exxon, second, quarter, earnings, conference, call, management, reiterated, importance, returning, value, shareholders, via, stable, growing, dividend, However, major, energy, industry, peers, like, BP, Royal, Dutch, Shell, slashed, dividends, point, hardly, unreasonable, investors, think, Exxon, could, end, following, trend, In, fact, point, company, commitment, dividend, really, thing, keeping, current, level, Exxon, cash, flow, sufficient, cover, dividend, payments, right, 
Which, brings, balance, sheet, back, play, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, started, around, 0, 24, times, As, oil, prices, demand, fell, face, COVID, 19, related, economic, shut, downs, company, added, debt, cover, material, capital, investment, plans, dividend, This, par, course, oil, space, highly, cyclical, Exxon, used, tactic, But, fly, ointment, During, second, quarter, conference, call, management, also, hinted, unlikely, issue, debt, That, limits, places, Exxon, find, additional, cash, needs, One, easy, way, free, capital, cut, dividend, costs, Exxon, around, 3, 7, billion, quarter, nearly, 15, billion, 
The, dividend, likely, safe, least, rest, 2020, But, point, materially, uncertainty, If, oil, prices, remain, moribund, dividend, cut, question, 
As, noted, Exxon, currently, middle, large, capital, investment, program, driven, weak, production, numbers, past, There, bigger, takeaway, Exxon, basically, doubling, oil, time, peers, like, Shell, France, Total, NYSE, TOT, pivoting, toward, electricity, The, logic, shift, pretty, simple, Carbon, based, fuels, replaced, cleaner, options, impacting, everything, transportation, utility, level, electricity, generation, Exxon, however, stressed, energy, transitions, historically, taken, long, time, oil, remain, important, energy, source, decades, come, This, take, backed, International, Energy, Agency, long, term, outlook, even, scenario, carbon, emission, reductions, global, focus,

And, yet, oil, prices, literally, fell, zero, early, part, 2020, hinting, things, right, energy, space, The, fact, oil, drillers, brief, moment, paying, customers, take, oil, frightening, However, prices, back, 40, per, barrel, space, suggesting, near, term, demise, oil, greatly, exaggerated, As, commodity, oil, subject, supply, demand, current, low, prices, driven, COVID, 19, demand, dislocations, causing, material, shakeout, industry, Many, exploration, production, companies, especially, U, S, onshore, space, filed, bankruptcy, Eventually, though, might, painful, supply, demand, likely, balance, Financially, strong, Exxon, positioned, benefit, happens, For, investors, bearish, oil, however, Exxon, decision, redouble, efforts, black, gold, worrisome, 
There, material, risks, consider, looking, Exxon, hard, quantify, While, unlikely, Exxon, going, go, business, anytime, soon, lingering, low, energy, prices, could, lead, dividend, cut, And, oil, space, drives, company, top, bottom, lines, clearly, flux, today, Exxon, stock, appropriate, conservative, investors, quite, risk, profile, ago, If, looking, company, hefty, 8, yield, want, think, carefully, jumping, aboard, name, today, You, might, better, Chevron, stronger, financial, footing, Total, diversifying, business, adding, electricity, assets, portfolio, 
Three, 30, stocks, make, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, replaced, end, Standard, Poor, manages, blue, chip, index, announced, Monday, current, constituents, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Pfizer, NYSE, PFE, Raytheon, Technologies, NYSE, RTX, swapped, Salesforce, com, NYSE, CRM, Amgen, NASDAQ, AMGN, Honeywell, International, NYSE, HON, respectively, 
Updates, Dow, components, unusual, Not, including, changes, stemming, mergers, acquisitions, Standard, Poor, altered, Dow, components, recently, 2018, replaced, General, Electric, Walgreens, Boots, Alliance, Like, recently, announced, restructuring, one, ultimately, intended, make, Dow, accurate, cross, section, U, S, market, 
Still, 10, entire, index, holdings, scheduled, replacement, one, sweeping, move, could, lead, buy, hold, investors, Dow, based, index, funds, wonder, much, buying, holding, really, able, instruments, If, worry, The, overdue, move, actually, makes, comfortable, long, term, investors, Dow, based, ETFs, mutual, funds, 
The, announcement, Standard, Poor, explains, 
The, index, changes, prompted, DJIA, constituent, Apple, Inc, decision, split, stock, 4, 1, reduce, index, weight, Global, Industry, Classification, Standard, GICS, Information, Technology, sector, The, announced, changes, help, offset, reduction, They, also, help, diversify, index, removing, overlap, companies, similar, scope, adding, new, types, businesses, better, reflect, American, economy, 
The, explanation, touches, something, fully, clarified, within, announcement, Unlike, indices, assign, weight, degree, influence, holding, based, company, total, capitalization, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, price, weighted, index, For, example, constituent, shares, priced, 100, apiece, cause, net, change, Dow, shares, 50, stock, even, 100, stock, represents, smaller, organization, It, entirely, possible, smallest, name, Dow, measured, market, cap, could, still, make, biggest, impact, index, daily, point, changes, company, stock, highest, priced, ticker, among, 30, make, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, 
In, words, pricing, methodology, used, creates, situation, Dow, necessarily, accurate, collective, reflection, stock, market, established, names, 
That, case, late, If, anything, index, skewed, exact, opposite, reason, The, Dow, world, biggest, company, Apple, also, happened, highest, priced, component, quite, time, split, announcement, The, 4, 1, split, drastically, reduce, high, degree, influence, Apple, stock, Dow, future, 
That, good, thing, reduce, index, overall, day, day, volatility, big, change, alone, would, also, mean, sudden, significant, shift, Dow, diversification, reflection, broader, market, By, removing, Exxon, Pfizer, Raytheon, adding, Salesforce, Honeywell, Amgen, Standard, Poor, also, trying, restore, much, needed, sector, balance, index, That, curb, Dow, prospective, volatility, without, necessarily, crimping, performance, 
It, also, worth, noting, ExxonMobil, Raytheon, two, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, weaker, performers, since, time, last, subpar, performance, perhaps, linked, COVID, 19, pandemic, Regardless, reason, foreseeable, futures, look, much, different, recent, pasts, The, removal, laggards, may, allow, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, close, performance, gap, S, P, 500, 
For, investors, holding, index, based, holdings, like, SPDR, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, ETF, Trust, NYSEMKT, DIA, Vanguard, 500, Index, Fund, NASDAQMUTFUND, VFIN, X, big, changes, raise, questions, The, underlying, strategy, passive, index, investing, owning, broad, piece, market, best, names, long, haul, letting, time, work, Now, noted, 10, portfolio, slated, replaced, one, fell, swoop, nothing, prevent, The, move, may, mean, shedding, names, prefer, continue, owning, time, Maybe, liked, Dow, mix, heavy, Apple, pharmaceuticals, energy, defense, light, tech, biotech, industrials, Maybe, fan, Amgen, posted, encouraging, quarterly, numbers, July, otherwise, high, growth, machine, late, 
The, point, Dow, character, change, Perhaps, change, dramatically, sector, makeup, changed, way, could, impact, performance, going, forward, 
If, concern, put, rest, 
If, anything, sizable, changes, Dow, makeup, actually, overdue, The, Dow, less, ideally, balanced, without, investors, even, realizing, Apple, shares, priced, unusually, high, levels, time, Energy, name, Chevron, still, Dow, component, given, oil, gas, industry, may, never, one, name, may, enough, Pfizer, taken, DJIA, drug, company, Merck, remains, There, biotech, biopharma, stock, Amgen, ilk, Dow, right, arguably, Raytheon, shed, Boeing, still, component, index, Perhaps, ironic, without, impending, addition, Honeywell, would, still, factory, centered, industrial, name, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, 
Standard, Poor, moves, planned, end, ultimately, make, Dow, better, balanced, diverse, index,

The, real, surprise, oil, gas, giant, ExxonMobil, shown, door, ExxonMobil, Dow, component, since, 1928, back, known, Standard, Oil, Co, New, Jersey, Next, General, Electric, roughly, 110, consecutive, run, Dow, ended, General, Electric, kicked, Dow, 2018, ExxonMobil, 91, streak, Dow, second, longest, And, come, unceremonious, end,

On, surface, appear, number, reasons, S, P, Dow, Jones, Indices, made, changes, 
As, noted, Pfizer, Merck, somewhat, redundant, Big, Pharma, entries, one, bound, get, boot, eventually, The, addition, Amgen, provides, mature, company, potentially, robust, long, term, growth, rate, relative, pharmaceutical, stalwart, like, Pfizer, 
An, argument, could, also, made, addition, Salesforce, adds, cloud, computing, exposure, Dow, beyond, exposure, offered, IBM, 
But, real, reasons, S, P, Dow, Jones, Indices, removing, ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Raytheon, You, see, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, price, weighted, index, This, means, share, price, market, cap, matters, calculating, indexes, point, value, Thus, 200, per, share, stock, twice, influence, 100, stock, four, times, influence, 50, stock, regardless, market, cap, 
ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Raytheon, respective, share, prices, 42, 22, 38, 84, 61, 88, closing, bell, Aug, 24, Using, current, Dow, divisor, approximately, 0, 147, every, 1, share, price, worth, approximately, 6, 78, Dow, points, Adding, share, prices, ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Raytheon, shows, responsible, 969, 21, Dow, points, combined, basis, 
Comparatively, incoming, Salesforce, Amgen, Honeywell, respective, share, prices, 208, 46, 235, 57, 159, 37, Admittedly, incoming, stocks, along, pending, 4, 1, split, Apple, cause, Dow, divisor, adjusted, coming, days, But, fact, changes, share, price, company, relative, influence, Dow, probably, little, else, 
The, Dow, Jones, undoubtedly, rich, history, almost, unusable, index, today, standards, given, many, flaws, 
As, stated, share, price, weighted, index, pay, heed, market, cap, This, means, investment, bank, Goldman, Sachs, 71, billion, market, cap, 207, 34, share, price, nearly, five, times, influence, networking, giant, Cisco, Systems, 42, 18, share, price, twice, market, cap, 178, billion, 
What, Dow, great, job, representing, varied, sectors, U, S, economy, Unlike, broad, based, S, P, 500, find, utilities, real, estate, representation, Dow, Jones, There, soon, one, energy, stock, Chevron, go, along, one, materials, company, Dow, 
Lastly, Dow, divisor, dependent, share, price, largest, companies, world, large, share, prices, could, never, join, index, For, example, Amazon, Alphabet, parent, company, behind, Google, search, YouTube, respective, third, fourth, largest, companies, U, S, market, cap, But, shares, prices, north, 3, 300, approaching, 1, 600, Amazon, Alphabet, chance, joining, Dow, without, enacting, stock, split,
