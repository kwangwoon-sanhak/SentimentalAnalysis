Better, late, never, 
After, dithering, weeks, oil, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, finally, announced, going, cut, 2020, capital, spending, levels, operational, expenses, With, decision, joins, fellow, oil, majors, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Total, NYSE, TOT, taking, action, preserve, cash, dividend, payments, 
It, detailed, plan, enough, Here, dividend, investors, need, know, 
ExxonMobil, CEO, Darren, Woods, late, convert, cost, cutting, party, In, fact, originally, exactly, opposite, planned, 2020, promising, big, increases, capital, spending, At, company, investor, day, March, 5, announced, ExxonMobil, would, use, strength, balance, sheet, invest, cycle, 
Ordinarily, bad, strategy, ExxonMobil, strong, balance, sheet, good, credit, rating, times, tough, companies, feeling, pinch, sometimes, willing, sell, assets, steep, discount, However, day, Woods, announced, plan, OPEC, alliance, failed, reach, agreement, production, limits, oil, prices, fell, almost, 50, around, 25, per, barrel, Because, none, oil, majors, would, able, profitably, produce, oil, prices, investors, got, concerned, potential, dividend, cuts, 
Many, Exxon, peers, also, solid, balance, sheets, credit, ratings, quickly, announced, 2020, spending, cuts, reassure, investors, dividends, would, safe, Shell, Total, announced, cuts, 2020, capital, spending, March, 23, Chevron, projected, 20, cut, March, 25, Total, Shell, also, suspended, share, buyback, programs, 
Woods, dragged, feet, though, Although, Exxon, released, statement, claiming, considering, cuts, specific, management, commit, particular, strategy, Observers, wondered, whether, Woods, considering, damn, torpedoes, full, speed, ahead, spending, plan, would, almost, certainly, resulted, backlash, investors, 
Ultimately, though, Woods, seems, seen, light, releasing, detailed, response, April, 7, However, signs, totally, abandoned, original, ambitions, 
Exxon, cost, reductions, include, 30, cut, 2020, capital, spending, 23, billion, It, also, plans, reduce, operating, expenses, 15, Like, many, producers, Exxon, decided, largest, share, cuts, come, Texas, Permian, Basin, A, final, investment, decision, offshore, opportunity, Mozambique, also, delayed, 
On, hand, Exxon, promising, deepwater, drilling, operations, offshore, Guyana, northern, coast, South, America, largely, moving, ahead, planned, Some, additional, developments, may, delayed, six, 12, company, waits, government, approval, add, third, production, vessel, Payara, field, Deepwater, drilling, higher, front, exploration, costs, shale, drilling, wells, installed, longer, lifespans, fewer, associated, expenses, constant, churn, onshore, shale, wells, 
The, 30, cut, 2020, capex, surprisingly, large, considering, Chevron, Shell, Total, announced, capital, spending, cuts, 20, However, Woods, seem, completely, abandoned, spending, ambitions, In, statement, announcing, 2020, cuts, Woods, noted, emphasis, added, 
The, long, term, fundamentals, underpin, company, business, plans, changed, population, energy, demand, grow, economy, rebound, Our, capital, allocation, priorities, also, remain, unchanged, Our, objective, continue, investing, industry, advantaged, projects, create, value, preserve, cash, dividend, make, appropriate, prudent, use, balance, sheet, 
In, short, term, Exxon, ability, pay, dividend, never, really, doubt, The, company, strong, credit, rating, sturdy, enough, balance, sheet, weather, several, reduced, oil, prices, without, putting, long, term, financial, health, jeopardy, With, 30, cut, capital, spending, ExxonMobil, able, devote, significantly, cash, help, fund, dividend, 
Luckily, Exxon, oil, companies, general, OPEC, recently, agreed, cut, production, 9, 7, million, barrels, day, While, enough, offset, coronavirus, triggered, lack, demand, recent, news, reports, seem, suggest, pandemic, may, peaking, earlier, expected, If, indeed, case, global, travel, bans, one, cause, drop, demand, oil, based, fuels, may, lifted, sooner, rather, later, 
These, conditions, could, change, moment, notice, course, Exxon, looks, almost, certain, continue, 37, streak, annual, dividend, increases, 
Woods, seems, successfully, threaded, needle, He, placating, markets, cutting, expenses, short, term, recommitting, long, term, strategy, company, That, actually, good, thing, Investors, want, CEO, change, company, long, term, strategy, sake, juicing, share, price, short, term, 
If, conditions, change, significantly, say, COVID, 19, makes, resurgence, new, oil, production, limits, fall, apart, investors, probably, reexamine, company, prospects, For, though, Exxon, looks, like, buy, dividend, investors, 
With, oil, prices, continuing, hover, extremely, low, levels, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, taken, action, shore, finances, 
The, energy, giant, Monday, raised, 9, 5, billion, selling, five, new, bond, issues, maturities, ranging, five, 31, according, Reuters, report, The, article, noted, ExxonMobil, originally, planned, raise, 9, billion, offering, higher, capital, raise, indicates, demand, strong, bond, issue, 
Last, week, ExxonMobil, announced, would, cut, 2020, capital, spending, 30, would, reduce, operating, expenses, 15, All, moves, made, response, conditions, heavy, oversupply, oil, market, situation, caused, steep, plunge, demand, due, COVID, 19, pandemic, producers, pumping, glut, crude, 
Though, ExxonMobil, paying, borrow, prior, pandemic, Reuters, article, noted, bond, rates, issue, lower, bonds, company, sold, approximately, four, weeks, ago, This, sign, investor, confidence, improving, period, high, volatility, equity, energy, markets, 
In, announcing, company, operational, cutbacks, last, week, Chairman, CEO, Darren, Woods, said, moves, meant, improve, ExxonMobil, financial, position, markets, rebound, preserve, cash, dividend, make, appropriate, prudent, use, balance, sheet, 
The, new, debt, deal, improve, cash, position, particularly, debt, market, receptive, new, issuers, according, report,
