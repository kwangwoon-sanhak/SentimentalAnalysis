Every, day, Wall, Street, analysts, upgrade, stocks, downgrade, others, initiate, coverage, But, analysts, even, know, talking, Today, taking, one, high, profile, Wall, Street, pick, putting, microscope, 
One, analyst, downgrade, One, price, target, cut, One, inflammatory, allegation, subscription, required, investigation, state, attorney, general, 
June, long, shareholders, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, stock, endure, long, last, July, may, looking, ExxonMobil, investors, 
This, morning, ExxonMobil, stock, received, first, upgrade, StreetInsider, com, subscription, required, reported, analysts, Barclays, Capital, rerated, stock, overweight, The, news, good, doubt, one, upgrade, one, analyst, reason, enough, dive, back, ExxonMobil, stock, despite, ongoing, troubles, oil, market, 
Here, three, things, need, know, 
Let, start, upgrade, Over, past, ExxonMobil, stock, lost, 15, value, stock, market, risen, 14, This, recent, underperformance, says, Barclays, unfair, Exxon, given, company, leading, near, term, position, market, oil, cheap, ability, profit, sales, liquefied, natural, gas, petrochemicals, In, analyst, view, Exxon, stock, worth, far, 80, change, shares, currently, fetch, much, 94, share, fact, 
Barclays, emphasis, Exxon, ability, earn, profits, generate, cash, crucially, continue, paying, 3, 8, dividend, could, important, evaluating, downgrade, That, time, Barclays, making, positive, noises, Exxon, rival, banker, Bernstein, updating, forecast, future, oil, prices, next, two, 
As, reported, TheFly, com, morning, Bernstein, forecasts, oil, prices, hover, around, 50, barrel, way, 2018, well, OPEC, may, cutting, production, says, Bernstein, U, S, shale, producers, quickly, step, increase, production, time, oil, prices, begin, rise, Moreover, increased, oil, production, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, threatens, replace, declines, oil, production, fostered, OPEC, cuts, negating, effect, cuts, keeping, lid, oil, prices, 
And, brings, us, back, full, circle, Barclays, argument, oil, prices, remain, low, ExxonMobil, leading, near, term, position, profit, even, environment, cheap, oil, prices, If, oil, prices, remain, cheap, Barclays, seems, saying, ExxonMobil, stock, deserves, trade, 94, share, But, really, case, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
As, I, look, chart, I, see, two, recent, spikes, Exxon, price, approaching, Barclays, targeted, share, price, 94, In, one, case, late, last, spike, correlated, oil, prices, finally, rising, 50, In, case, mid, 2016, oil, prices, seemed, least, heading, direction, Prior, spikes, though, Exxon, rarely, reached, 94, unless, oil, selling, 90, barrel, 
Thus, seems, investors, really, value, Exxon, stock, 94, share, think, oil, prices, going, prices, least, better, 50, ideally, much, As, idea, ExxonMobil, stock, worth, 94, share, 50, per, barrel, lower, oil, environment, though, I, see, 
As, matter, fact, I, see, lot, value, ExxonMobil, shares, oil, price, likely, happen, time, near, future, At, current, oil, prices, seems, profit, ExxonMobil, able, produce, equal, 11, billion, annual, free, cash, flow, Weighed, stock, still, expensive, 341, billion, market, capitalization, works, valuation, 31, times, free, cash, flow, 
Unless, oil, prices, turn, around, start, growing, lot, faster, analysts, like, Bernstein, think, possible, I, see, ExxonMobil, grow, earnings, fast, enough, justify, kind, valuation, That, despite, good, news, Barclays, Capital, finally, upgrading, ExxonMobil, stock, I, still, think, stock, bad, news, investors,
