After, falling, three, consecutive, ExxonMobil, oil, equivalent, production, rose, 2019, The, growth, driven, increased, liquids, production, even, natural, gas, production, volumes, declined, The, higher, volumes, favorably, contributed, company, earnings, Moving, ahead, ExxonMobil, projects, including, Guyana, Permian, Basin, reach, full, capacity, continue, contribute, company, earnings,

Though, ExxonMobil, making, significant, investments, I, expect, exponential, growth, company, earnings, anytime, soon, unless, oil, prices, rise, significantly, current, levels, That, look, likely, However, long, oil, prices, fall, freely, happened, 2014, company, growth, plans, work, well, That, help, company, grow, earnings, steadily, supporting, stock, price, well, 5, yield, 
When, comes, buy, hold, investing, go, wrong, growth, value, stocks, However, research, Bank, America, Merrill, Lynch, tells, us, one, category, offer, higher, return, long, haul, According, 2016, report, analyzed, data, 90, period, beginning, 1926, value, stocks, offered, annualized, return, 17, compared, 12, 6, growth, stocks, 
Considering, stock, market, rough, days, recently, would, least, bit, surprising, see, investors, focusing, attention, value, stocks, That, following, three, companies, come, play, Consider, diverse, group, top, value, stocks, want, February, 
Last, week, integrated, oil, gas, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, released, fourth, quarter, full, results, Unfortunately, one, gushing, excitement, Rather, ExxonMobil, stock, hemorrhaging, per, share, profits, missed, forecasts, sending, share, price, levels, seen, since, 2011, 
On, one, hand, truth, fact, oil, gas, giants, like, ExxonMobil, going, turn, businesses, dime, They, somewhat, prisoner, price, commodities, crude, oil, natural, gas, prices, weak, late, However, important, realize, weakness, commodities, may, overdone, due, coronavirus, fears, The, last, couple, times, health, scares, affected, oil, market, Ebola, impact, short, lived, I, expect, case, 
This, also, businesses, historically, hedged, long, term, success, ExxonMobil, bread, butter, remains, drilling, operations, upstream, downstream, refinery, chemical, segments, typically, come, play, commodity, prices, slump, e, demand, grows, access, fossil, fuels, becomes, cheaper, thereby, helping, partially, offset, drilling, weakness, Recently, company, seen, margin, weakness, segments, contributed, sinking, share, price, 
But, important, note, reasoning, behind, lower, margins, temporarily, including, higher, scheduled, maintenance, costs, refineries, weaker, high, sulfur, fuel, oil, pricing, fully, reflect, crude, spreads, according, Neil, Hansen, VP, investor, relations, ExxonMobil, These, short, term, issues, I, believe, lead, favorable, comparisons, moving, forward, 
At, 17, times, next, earnings, per, share, EPS, ExxonMobil, may, appear, value, stock, traditional, standards, However, ExxonMobil, cheap, price, book, basis, 1, 38, decade, inexpensive, relative, sales, since, 2014, ExxonMobil, value, stock, 5, 6, dividend, yield, icing, cake, 
On, opposite, end, spectrum, least, terms, market, cap, Elevate, Credit, NYSE, ELVT, small, cap, provider, lending, credit, solutions, U, S, U, K, people, average, credit, scores, e, subprime, 
Elevate, Credit, went, public, back, 2017, time, fintech, offerings, getting, clobbered, crushed, Oct, 2018, following, earnings, warning, This, particular, warning, notable, former, CEO, Elevate, Credit, Ken, Rees, noted, number, factors, caught, management, guard, The, company, wound, citing, delayed, technology, rollouts, higher, U, K, costs, tied, complaints, claims, management, companies, reasons, lowering, full, outlook, time, But, I, believe, case, ExxonMobil, short, term, concerns, 
What, Elevate, Credit, well, plant, perfectly, traditional, financial, institutions, money, lending, services, According, Elevate, far, people, non, prime, credit, scores, prime, meaning, huge, market, underbanked, consumers, It, offers, range, solutions, vary, traditional, credit, cards, bear, 29, 99, 34, 99, annual, percentage, rates, APR, installment, line, credit, loans, range, 36, 299, APR, This, probably, sounds, like, lot, much, higher, traditional, banks, But, access, traditional, lending, solutions, Elevate, offers, subprime, consumers, opportunity, utilize, lending, services, lower, APR, traditional, brick, mortar, money, lending, services, 
What, Elevate, also, reports, positive, credit, activity, lending, bureaus, consumers, pay, installments, time, brick, mortar, money, lending, services, This, help, subprime, consumers, improve, credit, scores, saving, money, long, run, 
Despite, high, charge, rate, would, expected, consumers, less, stellar, credit, scores, Elevate, even, higher, APRs, make, look, like, bargain, seven, times, next, EPS, After, growing, adjusted, EBITDA, 19, million, 2015, estimated, 137, 5, million, midpoint, 2019, looks, value, stock, want, February, going, forward, 
Finally, value, stock, investors, consider, orphan, drug, developer, Jazz, Pharmaceuticals, NASDAQ, JAZZ, company, worth, buying, February, 
For, past, six, Jazz, Pharmaceuticals, stock, pretty, much, gone, nowhere, Make, mistake, periods, ebb, flow, Jazz, share, price, virtually, unchanged, sat, Feb, 2014, This, concerns, generic, competition, could, wreck, sales, top, selling, drug, Xyrem, well, possibility, Congress, could, enact, form, drug, pricing, reform, You, see, Xyrem, one, handful, therapies, whose, list, price, skyrocketed, past, decade, often, target, drug, price, reform, discussions, 
That, potential, bad, news, The, good, news, least, investment, perspective, lawmakers, arguably, divided, ever, healthcare, reform, makes, highly, unlikely, Jazz, going, lose, pricing, power, anytime, soon, 
Additionally, Jazz, seen, robust, success, organic, label, expansion, growth, Xyrem, Sales, sleep, disorder, drug, Xyrem, totaled, 1, 21, billion, first, nine, 2019, 1, 03, billion, earlier, liable, head, higher, price, increases, new, indications, drive, growth, Sales, Vyxeos, Defitelio, also, double, digit, percentage, first, nine, 2019, 
According, estimates, Wall, Street, Jazz, EPS, expected, grow, 13, 70, 2018, north, 21, 2022, With, Jazz, Pharmaceuticals, already, valued, 8, times, next, EPS, sporting, PEG, ratio, 0, 8, anything, 1, considered, value, looks, one, top, bargains, drug, development, space,
