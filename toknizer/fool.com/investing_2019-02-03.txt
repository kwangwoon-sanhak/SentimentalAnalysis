ExxonMobil, lambasted, recent, declining, production, rates, return, longer, cream, crop, among, integrated, oil, gas, peers, The, plan, put, last, promising, ambitious, targets, earnings, involved, spending, lots, money, time, others, focusing, disciplined, spending, share, buybacks, 
This, quarter, showed, early, signs, plan, work, Total, production, slightly, last, liquids, production, 7, offset, deliberate, decisions, divest, assets, invest, maintaining, less, profitable, U, S, gas, production, More, importantly, new, production, sources, profitable, much, lower, prices, 
With, several, new, green, lighted, projects, three, business, segments, investors, expect, higher, capital, spending, 2019, likely, lead, lower, free, cash, flow, As, projects, come, fruition, though, deliver, significant, bottom, line, results, make, worth, investors, stick, around, 
Oil, volatile, commodity, prone, frequent, dramatic, price, swings, That, made, clear, 2018, oil, plunged, bear, market, matter, weeks, back, half, Despite, near, term, ups, downs, though, oil, remains, vital, source, energy, If, looking, sector, make, sure, include, least, one, energy, company, portfolio, ride, highs, lows, stride, That, basically, means, buy, either, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, Corporation, NYSE, CVX, two, U, S, energy, giants, real, staying, power, 
In, 2012, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, enacted, major, corporate, overhaul, It, spun, downstream, assets, refining, chemicals, businesses, called, industry, lingo, could, focus, upstream, drilling, business, This, shift, meant, oil, natural, gas, prices, main, factor, driving, company, top, bottom, lines, When, oil, prices, plummeted, mid, 2014, going, 100, barrel, 30, range, long, ConocoPhillips, forced, cut, dividend, 
The, 66, dividend, cut, 2016, painful, hit, income, investors, And, ConocoPhillips, increasing, dividend, lately, dividend, cut, always, back, mind, next, oil, downturn, could, lead, repeat, Neither, Exxon, Chevron, cut, dividends, rough, spot, oil, market, 
One, key, reason, Exxon, Chevron, diversified, operations, encompassing, upstream, downstream, sides, energy, business, This, important, refining, chemicals, businesses, operate, use, oil, natural, gas, key, inputs, Low, prices, net, benefit, lead, lower, operating, costs, chemicals, refining, side, 
To, put, number, Exxon, upstream, earnings, declined, nearly, 75, 2015, But, company, downstream, earnings, roughly, doubled, helping, offset, hit, low, oil, prices, limit, company, overall, earnings, decline, 50, And, 2014, 2015, 2016, Exxon, able, raise, dividend, Chevon, little, heavily, weighted, toward, oil, drilling, hiked, dividend, end, 2014, held, dividend, steady, throughout, 2015, increased, end, 2016, 
The, inherent, balance, companies, business, models, important, another, key, factor, consider, Exxon, Chevron, rock, solid, balance, sheets, One, best, ways, see, looking, financial, debt, equity, Both, Exxon, Chevron, sit, low, end, closest, peers, metric, examines, much, leverage, company, uses, That, pretty, much, pair, always, sits, comes, debt, 
XOM, FINANCIAL, DEBT, TO, EQUITY, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
That, gives, Exxon, Chevron, leeway, use, debt, maintain, operations, energy, prices, inevitably, fall, For, example, going, 2014, downturn, Chevron, long, term, debt, stood, around, 20, billion, 12, capital, structure, That, low, number, industry, To, maintain, capital, spending, support, dividend, deep, energy, bear, market, company, increased, leverage, upping, long, term, debt, around, 35, 2, billion, end, 2016, 
That, 75, increase, long, term, debt, pushed, Chevron, long, term, debt, around, 20, capital, structure, still, reasonable, perhaps, even, conservative, number, With, oil, prices, lows, Chevron, started, reduce, debt, The, picture, Exxon, way, roughly, similar, Exxon, historically, even, conservative, debt, front, 
The, mixture, balanced, business, models, industry, leading, balance, sheets, makes, Exxon, Chevron, resilient, oil, downturns, It, helps, explain, streaks, annual, dividend, increases, 36, 31, respectively, It, rare, company, industry, achieve, dividend, record, like, let, alone, companies, operate, highly, volatile, commodity, sector,

If, looking, solid, dividend, yield, energy, stock, two, names, might, list, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Brookfield, Renewable, Partners, NYSE, BEP, While, one, epitome, big, oil, representative, future, energy, known, high, dividend, yields, strong, cash, flows, keep, payouts, secure, long, track, records, growing, dividend, payments, regular, basis, 
Furthermore, things, favor, could, make, compelling, investments, right, ExxonMobil, sits, cheapest, oil, gas, assets, world, plans, better, leverage, integrated, business, could, see, pump, gusher, profits, coming, On, hand, Brookfield, Renewable, owns, best, cheapest, renewable, energy, producing, assets, world, management, proved, incredibly, skilled, growing, cash, flows, time,

Furthermore, unlike, oil, Brookfield, Renewable, deal, volatile, commodity, must, buy, produce, electricity, though, variances, wind, sun, rainfall, affect, much, power, facilities, produce, sell, The, end, result, business, generates, remarkably, steady, predictable, cash, flows, large, portion, management, committed, return, shareholders,

And, Brookfield, Renewables, already, proved, past, decade, best, place, invest, power, generating, assets, management, team, shown, skilled, capital, allocation, long, term, 
While, much, like, ExxonMobil, prospects, I, think, investors, much, better, long, term, invest, Brookfield, Renewable, Partners, As, much, ExxonMobil, continues, deliver, high, rates, return, owns, great, low, cost, oil, gas, assets, able, leverage, integrated, business, deliver, even, better, future, returns, many, questions, surrounding, fossil, fuels, pick, Brookfield, Renewable, 
Frankly, predicting, whether, oil, prices, rise, fall, hold, steady, future, though, almost, certainly, three, different, points, importantly, hard, predict, much, future, demand, oil, grow, 
Renewables, however, certainly, continue, grow, demand, costs, fall, And, since, I, rate, Brookfield, Renewables, management, team, right, ExxonMobil, comes, discipline, strong, capital, deployment, skills, go, business, better, predictable, path, forward, 
And, clearly, Brookfield, Renewable, Partners,
