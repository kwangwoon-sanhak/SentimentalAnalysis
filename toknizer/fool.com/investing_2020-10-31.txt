Operator, 
Thank, Mr, Littleton, Mr, Swiger, Mr, Williams, 
Operator, instructions, We, take, first, question, Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, 
Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, Analyst, 
So, capital, program, guys, basically, already, gave, us, hint, sort, categories, committed, close, pre, COVID, levels, ones, see, opportunity, stay, back, So, I, guess, I, focus, first, question, Permian, How, much, capital, reduction, 2021, already, built, completed, lot, facilities, infrastructure, spends, point, And, much, think, reduction, activity, planned, crisis, Thank, 
Andy, Swiger, Senior, Vice, President, Principal, Financial, Officer, 
Yes, Thanks, question, Sam, I, mentioned, earlier, 15, rigs, going, 10, think, 10, 12, rigs, going, 21, Of, course, eye, toward, market, 
That, substantially, earlier, plans, planning, continue, less, stay, rig, level, kind, 50, rig, 50, 60, rig, level, Permian, Growth, substantially, But, look, I, want, reinforce, decision, reduce, spin, due, cash, flow, constraints, reflection, development, results, quite, contrary, We, pleased, things, going, 
I, mentioned, efficiency, improvement, seen, We, continuing, gain, experience, cube, developments, confirming, lot, value, approach, So, confident, quality, resource, including, unique, development, plan, Delaware, Basin, also, logistics, integration, Gulf, Coast, So, really, like, seeing, We, going, curtail, activity, discretion, defer, move, capital, opportunities, 
Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, Analyst, 
And, I, think, I, follow, I, think, Andy, asset, sales, A, lot, businesses, organized, JVs, equity, affiliates, perspective, Stock, Analyst, usually, mean, anything, But, right, dividend, Exxon, level, stressed, given, environment, And, problem, always, align, capital, priorities, affiliates, 
So, instead, thinking, disposals, asset, category, segment, make, sense, think, perspective, asset, class, maybe, affiliate, positions, And, JVs, logical, place, look, disposals, least, sort, align, production, cash, uses, cash, priorities, 
Jack, Williams, Senior, Vice, President, 
Sam, thanks, question, Our, review, divestment, candidates, quite, comprehensive, looks, across, every, sort, different, way, cut, business, In, terms, think, longer, strategic, fit, criteria, divestment, regardless, whether, JV, equity, company, conventional, type, arrangements, So, go, process, continual, renewal, review, really, find, sort, categories, suggested, representing, sort, barrier, analysis, There, may, friction, depending, agreements, arrangements, forth, large, existed, worked, operator, partners, reach, resolution, able, put, right, assets, market, right, time, 
Operator, 
Your, next, question, comes, line, Devin, McDermott, Morgan, Stanley, 
Andy, Swiger, Senior, Vice, President, Principal, Financial, Officer,

Phil, Gresh, J, P, Morgan, Analyst, 
Andy, I, want, come, back, Slide, 29, talking, dividend, coverage, potential, 2021, If, I, look, oil, price, implying, third, quarter, low, end, historic, range, around, 40, oil, assumed, recovery, refining, margins, I, think, 2021, would, imply, 2, billion, 2, 8, billion, recovery, get, back, low, end, I, understood, correctly, So, I, guess, trying, imply, think, get, little, bit, recovery, refining, cover, dividend, low, 40s, organically,

Stephen, Littleton, Vice, president, Investor, Relations, Secretary, 
Thank, comments, Jack, Andy, We, happy, take, questions, might, Operator, please, open, phone, lines, questions, 
Operator, 
Thank, Mr, Littleton, Mr, Swiger, Mr, Williams, 
Operator, instructions, We, take, first, question, Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, 
Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, Analyst, 
So, capital, program, guys, basically, already, gave, us, hint, sort, categories, committed, close, pre, COVID, levels, ones, see, opportunity, stay, back, So, I, guess, I, focus, first, question, Permian, How, much, capital, reduction, 2021, already, built, completed, lot, facilities, infrastructure, spends, point, And, much, think, reduction, activity, planned, crisis, Thank, 
Andy, Swiger, Senior, Vice, President, Principal, Financial, Officer, 
Yes, Thanks, question, Sam, I, mentioned, earlier, 15, rigs, going, 10, think, 10, 12, rigs, going, 21, Of, course, eye, toward, market, 
That, substantially, earlier, plans, planning, continue, less, stay, rig, level, kind, 50, rig, 50, 60, rig, level, Permian, Growth, substantially, But, look, I, want, reinforce, decision, reduce, spin, due, cash, flow, constraints, reflection, development, results, quite, contrary, We, pleased, things, going, 
I, mentioned, efficiency, improvement, seen, We, continuing, gain, experience, cube, developments, confirming, lot, value, approach, So, confident, quality, resource, including, unique, development, plan, Delaware, Basin, also, logistics, integration, Gulf, Coast, So, really, like, seeing, We, going, curtail, activity, discretion, defer, move, capital, opportunities, 
Sam, Margolin, Wolfe, Research, Analyst, 
And, I, think, I, follow, I, think, Andy, asset, sales, A, lot, businesses, organized, JVs, equity, affiliates, perspective, Stock, Analyst, usually, mean, anything, But, right, dividend, Exxon, level, stressed, given, environment, And, problem, always, align, capital, priorities, affiliates, 
So, instead, thinking, disposals, asset, category, segment, make, sense, think, perspective, asset, class, maybe, affiliate, positions, And, JVs, logical, place, look, disposals, least, sort, align, production, cash, uses, cash, priorities, 
Jack, Williams, Senior, Vice, President, 
Sam, thanks, question, Our, review, divestment, candidates, quite, comprehensive, looks, across, every, sort, different, way, cut, business, In, terms, think, longer, strategic, fit, criteria, divestment, regardless, whether, JV, equity, company, conventional, type, arrangements, So, go, process, continual, renewal, review, really, find, sort, categories, suggested, representing, sort, barrier, analysis, There, may, friction, depending, agreements, arrangements, forth, large, existed, worked, operator, partners, reach, resolution, able, put, right, assets, market, right, time, 
Operator, 
Your, next, question, comes, line, Devin, McDermott, Morgan, Stanley, 
Andy, Swiger, Senior, Vice, President, Principal, Financial, Officer,
