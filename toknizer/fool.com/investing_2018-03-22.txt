Last, rough, one, oil, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Its, stock, tumbled, reporting, fourth, quarter, results, early, February, enduring, worst, day, since, 2011, slide, continued, next, day, investors, dug, deeper, report, began, growing, increasingly, concerned, ExxonMobil, falling, behind, peers, By, end, shares, oil, giant, tumbled, 15, wiping, stunning, 60, billion, market, cap, 
One, ExxonMobil, issues, invested, enough, money, developing, projects, offset, natural, decline, rate, legacy, oil, fields, As, result, output, dropped, 3, last, quarter, 3, 98, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, D, It, problem, company, plans, address, coming, ramping, investment, spending, could, boost, output, 1, million, BOE, D, 2025, While, impatient, investors, might, want, ExxonMobil, pursue, quick, fix, like, making, needle, moving, acquisition, likely, pay, much, current, strategy, coming, 
In, response, weak, fourth, quarter, results, ExxonMobil, outlined, aggressive, growth, plan, earlier, would, double, earnings, cash, flow, 2025, It, intends, getting, significantly, ramping, investments, calling, 24, billion, capital, spending, rise, 28, billion, 2019, averaging, 30, billion, annually, 2023, 2025, That, increase, spending, price, pay, cash, flow, according, CEO, Darren, Woods, noted, every, 1, ExxonMobil, spent, capital, expenses, past, decade, produced, 1, 20, operating, cash, flow, That, plan, would, put, company, pace, generate, 60, billion, annual, operating, cash, flow, 2025, assuming, 50, oil, 
While, ExxonMobil, expects, several, resource, plays, fuel, growth, two, drive, bulk, strategy, First, company, anticipates, fivefold, increase, output, Permian, Basin, resource, 2025, One, catalysts, growth, last, 6, 6, billion, purchase, Bass, gives, company, access, 4, 800, high, return, drilling, locations, region, The, main, fuel, oil, giant, massive, offshore, resource, discovery, Guyana, ExxonMobil, expects, first, phase, find, come, online, 2020, ones, powering, growth, 2025, 
ExxonMobil, strategy, would, see, spend, astonishing, 230, billion, next, eight, add, 30, billion, annual, cash, flow, assuming, 50, oil, That, 13, yield, investment, though, Woods, pointed, company, could, ultimately, earn, total, return, 120, outlay, For, comparison, sake, alternative, option, grow, cash, flow, would, make, significant, acquisition, Given, ExxonMobil, size, balance, sheet, strength, could, go, almost, direction, though, following, three, oil, companies, stand, given, ability, produce, gobs, cash, flow, right, 
If, ExxonMobil, wanted, move, needle, quickly, U, S, oil, giant, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, would, prime, target, considering, enterprise, value, nearly, 73, billion, While, represents, hefty, price, tag, ConocoPhillips, would, provide, immediate, cash, flow, boost, since, produced, 7, 1, billion, last, oil, averaged, 50, barrel, Though, put, perspective, less, 10, cash, flow, yield, purchase, price, without, deal, premium, financing, costs, suggesting, prospective, purchase, earn, ExxonMobil, high, return, capital, program, could, 
The, company, would, face, similar, issue, bought, EOG, Resources, NYSE, EOG, currently, 64, billion, price, tag, For, company, pace, produce, 6, billion, cash, flow, 50, oil, represents, less, 10, return, Anadarko, Petroleum, NYSE, APC, meanwhile, current, value, 44, 5, billion, While, also, cash, flow, machine, produce, 4, 6, billion, 50, oil, slightly, 10, return, ExxonMobil, gobbled, However, worth, noting, three, pace, produce, much, cash, current, oil, prices, EOG, expecting, generate, 1, 5, billion, free, cash, flow, Anadarko, pace, least, 1, billion, excess, cash, However, ExxonMobil, plan, would, also, generate, oil, price, In, words, company, would, likely, create, value, current, strategy, investing, high, return, expansion, projects, making, large, acquisition, 
ExxonMobil, need, make, acquisition, create, value, investors, since, invest, resource, base, double, cash, flow, eight, likely, earn, higher, return, process, While, strategy, requires, patience, investors, time, plan, make, company, recent, stumble, seem, like, distant, memory, 
After, last, quarter, earnings, report, concern, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, spinning, wheels, coherent, plan, grow, business, low, oil, price, environment, At, time, management, shorter, details, usual, saying, something, ExxonMobil, typically, pretty, tight, lipped, organization, It, appears, though, waiting, recent, analyst, meeting, provide, investors, details, plans, future, 
Based, things, management, highlighted, presentation, next, half, decade, likely, going, big, one, ExxonMobil, Here, five, takeaways, company, analyst, meeting, give, investors, idea, coming, pipe, 
Historically, ExxonMobil, one, company, industry, invests, business, thick, thin, It, significant, reason, company, maintained, higher, rates, return, peers, decades, During, recent, oil, downturn, though, management, uncharacteristically, elected, lower, capital, spending, completed, projects, preserve, balance, sheet, dividend, payments, much, possible, 
It, appears, flirtation, belt, tightening, come, end, though, management, plans, ratchet, capital, budget, next, 
IMAGE, SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
With, oil, prices, today, idea, Exxon, increasing, capital, spending, plan, around, 35, billion, annually, 2020, sounds, little, frightening, Looking, oil, gas, industry, though, appears, bet, could, headed, bit, supply, crunch, 
Exxon, peers, every, producer, concentrated, spending, either, maintaining, existing, production, levels, trying, squeeze, little, existing, assets, 2015, 2017, The, trade, much, sharper, drop, production, later, shorter, reservoir, life, With, existing, assets, likely, shorter, time, windows, general, lack, investment, new, production, sources, good, chance, oil, supply, could, tight, end, decade, Exxon, wants, ramp, spending, capture, market, comes, 
The, largest, knock, ExxonMobil, recently, complete, lack, production, growth, recent, While, brought, new, production, sources, nearly, enough, offset, declines, across, rest, portfolio, 
With, new, capital, spending, plan, though, Exxon, expects, deliver, 25, new, major, projects, increase, production, shale, oil, Permian, Basin, five, fold, Combined, grow, net, production, additional, 1, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, That, puts, Exxon, production, growth, plans, high, end, peers, major, turnaround, ago, production, plans, looked, meager, comparison, 
Increasing, capital, spending, production, large, amounts, sounds, great, probably, small, voice, back, head, saying, oil, prices, fall, 
It, legitimate, concern, probably, management, added, slide, presentation,

That, pretty, astounding, step, back, think, second, Management, estimates, grow, cash, flow, operations, 50, compared, 2017, oil, prices, remain, around, 40, barrel, 
Reading, first, thing, comes, mind, absurd, We, saw, happened, oil, went, 40, barrel, Exxon, cash, operations, dried, fast, One, ways, management, wants, address, put, greater, emphasis, investing, downstream, chemical, production, capabilities, 
Current, CEO, Darren, Woods, predecessors, Lee, Raymond, Rex, Tillerson, came, upstream, production, side, business, So, come, surprise, much, emphasis, time, growing, production, backfilling, reserves, discoveries, Woods, hand, downstream, guy, clear, wants, round, company, integrated, model, 
Between, 2025, company, start, operations, 13, new, chemical, production, facilities, worldwide, seven, start, end, 2018, Much, investment, going, U, S, Gulf, Coast, region, cheap, feedstock, costs, On, top, company, mulling, expansion, Beaumont, Texas, refinery, would, largest, increase, U, S, refining, capacity, decades, 
By, expanding, presence, refining, lubricants, petrochemical, manufacturing, ExxonMobil, helping, insulate, future, cash, flows, ups, downs, oil, prices, These, businesses, typically, well, production, struggling, It, also, helps, much, new, downstream, assets, located, place, use, production, Permian, Basin, allow, company, extract, value, molecule, 
XOM, RETURN, ON, EQUITY, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
In, rather, surprising, turn, events, ExxonMobil, temporarily, lost, crown, integrated, oil, gas, company, highest, return, equity, 2017, With, spending, plan, though, management, intends, recapture, title, also, put, lot, breathing, room, competition, 
According, management, able, achieve, average, return, capital, employed, 15, 2025, oil, remaining, around, 60, barrel, considerable, upside, see, uptick, prices, If, see, rise, prices, company, upstream, spending, plan, suggests, Exxon, could, produce, rather, incredible, returns, next, decade, 
There, lot, like, Exxon, strategic, plan, While, investors, like, growth, production, increasing, rates, return, also, encouraging, see, many, spending, plans, seem, relatively, safe, Unlike, prior, wave, investment, involved, several, mega, projects, remote, parts, world, lot, investments, known, quantities, makes, safer, bet, The, riskiest, projects, plan, offshore, Guyana, project, massive, LNG, export, terminal, Mozambique, If, one, critique, plan, company, still, seems, underinvesting, alternatives, existing, business, may, needed, road, 
If, investors, concerned, Exxon, future, investment, next, though, plan, put, concerns, bed,
