The, market, seems, keep, thinking, recovery, oil, prices, around, corner, sending, oil, prices, higher, lower, based, bullish, bearish, comments, day, But, likely, time, oil, prices, move, much, higher, 
The, behemoth, oil, market, simply, heading, oversupplied, situation, quickly, turn, around, So, energy, stocks, pain, reaching, eventual, equilibrium, 
There, lot, oil, 
According, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, global, oil, markets, oversupplied, 1, 8, million, barrels, per, day, third, quarter, 2015, That, result, weaker, expected, global, economy, really, driven, U, S, adding, 2, 5, million, barrels, per, day, supply, global, market, last, two, alone, 
IMAGE, U, S, ENERGY, INFORMATION, ADMINISTRATION, 
Of, course, low, oil, prices, hurt, U, S, oil, producers, production, even, led, oil, consumption, energy, markets, big, complex, oil, prices, simply, rise, oil, producers, slow, drilling, new, oil, 
The, long, lag, oil, supply, 
It, may, seem, like, oil, prices, would, balance, equilibrium, price, somewhere, around, 70, 80, per, barrel, shale, supply, would, go, offline, companies, countries, would, go, financial, hardship, stabilize, supply, demand, But, way, real, world, works, 
Even, high, cost, producers, U, S, would, hedged, oil, production, second, half, 2014, well, 2015, meaning, prices, dropped, near, 50, per, barrel, suddenly, shut, production, For, example, Continental, Resources, NYSE, CLR, one, biggest, shale, producers, U, S, enough, hedges, last, take, 433, million, one, time, gain, selling, hedges, third, quarter, Of, course, backfired, bit, oil, fallen, since, company, forced, report, loss, 131, 6, million, first, half, 
And, even, though, Continental, Resources, slashed, capital, spending, 4, 8, billion, expected, 2, 4, billion, 2015, expecting, increase, production, 19, 23, It, taken, long, time, cut, back, production, take, today, low, oil, prices, result, lower, production, 
Budgets, big, oil, business, also, set, long, time, horizons, based, short, term, price, swings, making, even, harder, adjust, prices, In, 2013, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, set, five, capital, budget, plan, 190, billion, including, multibillion, dollar, projects, like, Kearl, oil, sands, LNG, plant, Papua, New, Guinea, Cutting, capital, budgets, 2015, 12, 34, billion, may, slow, small, projects, behemoth, projects, drive, company, energy, production, planned, ahead, time, That, takes, long, adjust, oil, prices, big, oil, found, beneficial, diversify, supply, chain, refining, marketing, gasoline, benefits, low, oil, prices, experience, upstream, Then, ExxonMobil, make, knee, jerk, reactions, price, oil, based, 
The, long, lag, oil, prices, drop, actual, production, drops, means, could, take, supply, demand, go, 1, 8, million, barrels, per, day, line, equilibrium, 
2016, bring, progress, maybe, higher, prices, 
While, production, fall, much, OPEC, energy, investors, may, hoped, 2015, may, 2016, The, EIA, already, predicting, U, S, oil, production, fall, 400, 000, barrels, per, day, 2016, demand, expected, rise, 1, 4, million, barrels, per, day, globally, Given, current, oversupply, 1, 8, million, barrels, per, day, could, bring, markets, balance, sometime, next, Middle, Eastern, supply, 
Iran, sanctions, lifted, Saudi, Arabia, insistence, slowly, increasing, oil, production, could, leave, market, unbalanced, adding, 1, million, barrels, supply, per, day, That, could, push, balance, back, end, 2016, 2017, 
What, clear, market, forces, finally, starting, work, favor, energy, investors, It, may, take, another, forces, push, oil, prices, higher, smaller, number, well, positioned, companies, remain, Long, term, oil, going, anywhere, companies, weather, storm, positioned, big, time, winners, oil, prices, rise, By, look, matter, time,
