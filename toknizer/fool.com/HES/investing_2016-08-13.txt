The, Bakken, shale, rise, prominence, oil, industry, nothing, short, remarkable, While, first, oil, discovery, dates, back, 1951, oil, trapped, within, tight, shale, rocks, posed, real, technical, challenge, industry, Because, early, 2000s, combination, horizontal, drilling, hydraulic, fracturing, made, Bakken, technically, economically, viable, production, In, fact, extraction, techniques, combined, triple, digit, oil, prices, unleashed, oil, boom, North, Dakota,

While, geoscientists, long, speculated, much, oil, resided, region, oil, boom, kicked, high, gear, investors, started, taking, resource, estimates, seriously, That, especially, true, U, S, Geological, Survey, released, updated, assessment, 2008, estimating, 3, billion, 4, 3, billion, barrels, oil, recoverable, using, technology, available, time, That, said, producers, continued, drill, refine, techniques, led, USGS, ratchet, ultimate, recovery, 7, 4, billion, barrels, oil, 2014, Meanwhile, others, estimate, much, 24, billion, barrels, oil, could, eventually, recovered, perspective, would, completely, satisfy, American, oil, consumption, three, years, current, consumption, rate, 
While, oil, trickling, Bakken, since, early, 1950s, become, large, scale, producer, 2007, However, production, ramped, dramatically, since, rising, less, 100, 000, barrels, per, day, 2007, 1, million, barrels, per, day, 2014, That, remarkable, growth, largely, fueled, play, five, dominant, players,

In, 2004, Continental, Resources, NYSE, CLR, 
completed, first, commercially, successful, well, drilled, horizontally, using, hydraulic, fracturing, North, Dakota, Bakken, It, also, first, drill, horizontal, well, neighboring, Three, Forks, formation, Because, first, mover, play, surprise, see, Continental, Resources, leading, producer, dominate, acreage, position, While, low, oil, prices, recent, years, forced, company, slam, breaks, production, growth, company, enormous, resource, base, fuel, growth, prices, improve, 
Whiting, Petroleum, NYSE, WLL, 
ascended, positon, top, producer, Bakken, late, 2014, paying, 6, billion, acquire, rival, Kodiak, Oil, Gas, However, significant, drop, oil, prices, since, time, forced, Whiting, Petroleum, cut, investment, spending, caused, production, decline, That, said, instead, investing, capital, grow, production, downturn, Whiting, focusing, development, dollars, improving, well, productivity, The, initial, results, remarkable, company, recent, wells, experiencing, triple, digit, improvement, initial, production, rates, versus, legacy, wells, 
Hess, NYSE, HES, 
leading, acreage, position, Bakken, bulk, located, right, core, play, Because, Hess, believes, able, recover, 1, 6, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, Bakken, years, come, Furthermore, thanks, lean, manufacturing, approach, Hess, lowest, drilling, costs, play, That, combination, position, oil, saturated, core, industry, leading, cost, structure, enable, Hess, earn, highest, returns, play, current, commodity, prices, 
ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
acquired, initial, position, oil, rich, Bakken, purchased, XTO, Energy, 2009, It, boosted, stake, 50, 2012, via, another, acquisition, However, company, quick, acquire, acreage, taken, much, methodical, approach, development, taking, time, study, play, investing, capital, necessary, unlock, 900, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, lie, underneath, acreage, Those, development, plans, mostly, remain, hold, due, oil, market, downturn, However, given, vast, capital, resources, ExxonMobil, could, quickly, ascend, top, heap, Bakken, prices, improve, 
Like, Bakken, producers, EOG, Resources, NYSE, EOG, 
moderated, drilling, plans, amid, downturn, oil, market, This, year, company, expects, complete, roughly, 35, wells, combined, Bakken, Rockies, oil, plays, compared, 48, last, year, But, since, company, approximately, 2, 100, future, drilling, locations, remaining, Rockies, potentially, produce, 1, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, Needless, say, oil, prices, improve, EOG, Resources, likely, devote, cash, pull, oil, ground, 
The, Bakken, shale, contains, enormous, amount, recoverable, oil, At, moment, however, producers, letting, oil, stay, ground, prices, low, When, prices, improve, future, though, play, could, boom, activity, likely, led, five, dominant, producers,
