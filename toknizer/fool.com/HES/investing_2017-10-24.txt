Unlike, Conoco, Hess, able, turn, profit, Q1, seems, unlikely, company, able, post, profit, Q3, However, investors, look, Hess, loss, compares, last, year, In, Q1, Q2, 2017, operating, losses, smaller, prior, year, suggesting, company, moving, right, direction, In, Q3, 2016, Hess, adjusted, loss, 340, million, 1, 12, per, share, An, improvement, figure, would, show, Hess, indeed, moving, right, direction, able, improve, operations, even, low, price, environment, 
Although, Hess, primary, operations, Bakken, Shale, North, Dakota, significant, presence, Gulf, Mexico, means, Hurricane, Harvey, possibly, Tropical, Storm, Nate, could, affected, operations, I, say, could, unlike, Apache, Hess, issued, press, release, subject, except, announce, admirable, donation, 1, million, support, Hurricane, Harvey, relief, Similarly, larger, ConocoPhillips, pledged, 5, million, made, statement, hurricane, effect, operations, 
But, hurricane, certainly, sort, impact, company, regional, headquarters, Houston, While, unlikely, Hess, Gulf, Mexico, rigs, sustained, damage, Bureau, Safety, Environmental, Enforcement, reported, 13, 8, Gulf, Mexico, platforms, 50, non, dynamic, drilling, rigs, evacuated, Harvey, About, 18, 5, Gulf, oil, gas, activity, shut, storm,

Even, though, trading, near, 12, year, low, Hess, one, sector, better, balance, sheets, least, end, Q2, 
Oil, drillers, notorious, carrying, heavy, debt, loads, Conoco, example, 11, 7, billion, net, long, term, debt, balance, sheet, Hess, hand, managed, keep, load, manageable, It, currently, sports, debt, capital, ratio, 31, 9, among, lowest, peer, group, Apache, far, higher, 57, 8, even, well, capitalized, Conoco, 43, 8, 
As, end, second, quarter, Hess, also, sitting, 2, 5, billion, cash, 600, million, debt, maturing, 2019, I, looking, see, able, keep, balance, sheet, great, shape, even, oil, prices, company, dividend, yield, rose, 2, 2, similar, best, class, Apache, 
Although, probably, front, center, I, keeping, eye, updated, balance, sheet, make, sure, signs, slippage, 
Hess, one, oil, driller, definitely, investors, watch, lists, virtue, strong, balance, sheet, nice, dividend, yield, long, term, possibilities, joint, venture, ExxonMobil, offshore, Guyana,
