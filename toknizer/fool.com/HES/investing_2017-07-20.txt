recently, approved, phase, one, Liza, Field, offshore, development, Guyana, That, 3, 2, billion, project, produce, 120, 000, barrels, per, day, 2020, unlocks, 450, million, barrels, oil, underneath, section, field, Overall, ExxonMobil, believes, Liza, holds, much, 2, 5, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, resource, potential, companies, already, prepping, Liza, Phase, 2, This, balanced, combination, onshore, offshore, opportunities, puts, Hess, position, grow, output, healthy, clip, next, several, years, could, fuel, big, returns, investors, especially, today, stock, price, 
Oil, might, year, unlikely, stay, forever, However, even, Suncor, Concho, Hess, well, three, generate, healthy, cash, flow, thanks, low, cost, resources, When, combined, strong, balance, sheets, companies, continue, growing, even, oil, fall, That, ability, thrive, amid, uncertain, market, I, buy, one, right, especially, light, oil, induced, sell, offs, year,
