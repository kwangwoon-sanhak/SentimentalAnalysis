That, sell, might, value, hunting, investors, wondering, Hess, stock, buy, given, upside, higher, oil, prices, Here, look, bull, case, buying, stock, well, could, go, wrong, 
Hess, believes, deliver, high, octane, growth, coming, years, The, company, long, term, plan, foresees, compound, annual, growth, rates, 10, production, 20, cash, flow, 2025, That, strategy, would, see, generate, gusher, free, cash, flow, coming, years, assuming, oil, prices, cooperate, Hess, built, outlook, based, average, barrel, prices, 60, West, Texas, Intermediate, U, S, oil, benchmark, 64, Brent, global, benchmark, 
Two, engines, fuel, Hess, plan, First, expects, grow, production, Bakken, shale, North, Dakota, around, 200, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, 2021, leveling, Second, expects, partnership, ExxonMobil, finish, five, phases, offshore, Guyana, Those, two, engines, support, company, production, growth, plan, would, fuel, even, faster, pace, cash, flow, growth, 
Meanwhile, oil, prices, baseline, level, Hess, would, generate, even, free, cash, For, example, 75, Brent, oil, Hess, operations, would, produce, nearly, 8, billion, cash, flow, 2025, leaving, 5, billion, free, cash, covering, capital, spending, That, massive, amount, money, company, currently, 15, 5, billion, market, cap, It, would, give, company, funds, buy, back, meaningful, amount, stock, pay, higher, dividend, 
Because, Hess, oil, producer, changes, oil, prices, significant, impact, operations, That, case, year, Hess, already, cut, capital, spending, plan, twice, 3, billion, 1, 9, billion, 37, overall, preserve, financial, flexibility, amid, slumping, oil, prices, One, casualties, Bakken, shale, growth, engine, reduced, rig, count, six, one, The, company, Exxon, also, deferred, development, third, phase, Guyana, six, 12, months, While, setback, necessarily, derail, five, year, plan, 
However, oil, prices, improve, current, levels, 41, WTI, 43, Brent, Hess, probably, need, keep, lid, spending, plan, 2021, That, would, probably, significant, long, term, ramifications, since, would, prevent, company, achieving, Bakken, shale, production, target, next, year, delay, future, phases, offshore, Guyana, Thus, company, might, grow, production, cash, flow, fast, initially, anticipated, next, five, years, oil, prices, cooperate, 
If, oil, prices, improve, Hess, stock, could, soar, coming, years, since, would, give, fuel, deliver, ambitious, five, year, growth, plan, However, company, needs, significant, improvement, oil, prices, end, year, stay, track, It, higher, risk, oil, stock, might, best, option, investors, likely, remain, volatile, oil, price, environment,
