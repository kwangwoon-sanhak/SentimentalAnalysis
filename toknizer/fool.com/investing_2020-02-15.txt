Several, factors, make, ExxonMobil, top, bet, energy, sector, A, large, diversified, asset, base, places, ExxonMobil, strong, position, even, industry, trends, supportive, In, fact, scale, allows, make, investments, commodity, price, cycle, others, cannot, Even, though, ExxonMobil, debt, rose, bit, recently, company, leverage, conservative, 
ExxonMobil, higher, production, contributed, recent, investments, translate, improved, top, bottom, line, growth, come, While, Exxon, high, investments, look, like, risky, bet, company, strategy, indeed, quite, sound, The, company, making, investments, hopes, generate, higher, returns, divesting, assets, contributing, much, cash, flows, This, two, pronged, approach, help, ExxonMobil, grow, earnings, keeping, costs, control, 
Finally, recent, fall, ExxonMobil, stock, price, made, yield, attractive, More, importantly, given, company, track, record, dividend, growth, well, potential, free, cash, flow, growth, yield, looks, pretty, safe, ExxonMobil, 5, yield, makes, time, spent, waiting, stock, turn, around,

Everyone, seems, hate, oil, companies, today, one, reason, many, offer, dividends, big, fat, yields, The, problem, real, reasons, worried, energy, stocks, bankruptcies, picking, particularly, onshore, U, S, oil, space, But, oil, companies, created, equal, Some, better, built, weather, ups, downs, highly, cyclical, industry, 
Here, three, high, yield, oil, stocks, proven, takes, survive, keep, paying, generous, dividends, intrepid, investors, willing, buy, hold, others, grow, skittish, 
ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, probably, one, hated, integrated, oil, natural, gas, giants, world, massive, size, Though, ESG, investors, pushed, hard, convince, energy, company, management, change, course, decided, double, oil, drilling, They, unapologetic, plans, spend, much, 35, billion, capital, projects, like, expanding, onshore, U, S, oil, production, drilling, waters, around, Guyana,

In, fact, next, Exxon, likely, see, production, head, higher, contraction, Not, capital, spending, however, directed, toward, drilling, The, company, also, investing, downstream, operations, boosting, refining, petrochemical, manufacturing, capabilities, That, notable, like, next, two, companies, discussed, Exxon, diversified, across, energy, sector, That, gives, portfolio, balance, though, right, even, downstream, operations, performing, well, tough, environment, 
The, thing, Exxon, built, like, tank, handle, heavy, spending, weak, business, environment, For, example, debt, equity, ratio, around, 0, 15, puts, low, end, peer, group, frankly, low, range, company, industry, Now, add, dividend, increased, annually, 37, consecutive, currently, yields, 5, 8, toward, high, end, historical, range, see, contrarian, investors, investigating, stock, today, 
Perhaps, Exxon, decision, double, oil, drilling, little, much, In, case, might, want, look, peer, U, S, energy, giant, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, It, one, largest, diversified, energy, companies, Earth, But, unlike, Exxon, decided, conservative, capital, spending, plans, earmarking, 20, billion, toward, Relative, cash, flow, operations, lowest, level, peer, group, 
That, said, Chevron, benefiting, previous, spending, production, still, growing, right, Thus, hardly, giving, oil, falling, behind, peers, like, Exxon, major, effort, underway, onshore, U, S, oil, space, The, big, difference, Chevron, way, invest, energy, sector, without, accepting, risks, inherent, big, investments, Exxon, making, 
XOM, FINANCIAL, DEBT, TO, EQUITY, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Chevron, meanwhile, also, extremely, attractive, look, dividend, history, dividend, yield, balance, sheet, The, company, increased, payout, annually, 32, The, yield, currently, robust, 4, 7, And, like, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, sits, near, low, end, industry, roughly, 0, 15, Chevron, balance, sheet, built, like, rock, company, take, current, oil, downturn, stride,

To, fair, Total, still, primarily, oil, gas, company, It, planning, drastic, overnight, changes, It, using, core, operations, foundation, position, clean, energy, future, If, sounds, like, better, path, Exxon, Chevron, taking, well, served, take, close, look, Total, right, 
Oil, industry, executives, clear, future, oil, going, away, energy, source, anytime, soon, still, high, demand, Put, simply, oil, continues, play, integral, role, world, The, current, price, weakness, par, course, commodity, known, volatility, Exxon, Chevron, Total, built, deal, ups, downs, continuing, pay, investors, well, stick, around,
