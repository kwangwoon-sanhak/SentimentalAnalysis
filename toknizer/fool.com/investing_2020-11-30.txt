Shares, oil, stocks, including, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, crashed, sharply, lower, Monday, trading, ending, day, 5, 1, 7, 1, 7, 5, respectively, In, part, share, price, declines, traced, back, declines, price, oil, expect, cost, WTI, crude, falling, 0, 8, today, Brent, crude, prices, declining, 1, 2, But, part, story, bigger, single, day, change, cost, crude, oil, 
After, declines, 0, 8, even, 1, 2, big, certainly, big, enough, explain, 7, 5, decline, Conoco, share, price, What, look, closely, might, notice, price, oil, actually, nearly, 5, past, week, 
So, explain, declines, Well, consider, happening, news, lately, On, Wednesday, last, week, day, Thanksgiving, perhaps, investors, paying, much, attention, direction, oil, futures, The, Wall, Street, Journal, reported, come, possession, ExxonMobil, internal, documents, And, according, documents, oil, giant, anticipating, lower, oil, prices, much, next, decade, 
Indeed, ExxonMobil, revised, forecasts, predict, oil, prices, 11, 17, lower, previously, forecast, next, seven, energy, demand, remains, dampened, result, slower, economy, post, coronavirus, around, world, 
Nor, ExxonMobil, one, worried, As, CNBC, reported, today, OPEC, officials, see, immense, challenges, pandemic, OPEC, President, Abdelmadjid, Attar, warns, coronavirus, dealt, massive, severe, blow, global, oil, industry, pandemic, continues, rage, cases, soaring, many, regions, around, world, demand, fuel, may, remain, depressed, least, 2021, prompting, renewed, calls, extended, production, cuts, 
The, good, news, energy, investors, production, cuts, probably, going, happen, eventually, As, Reuters, reported, afternoon, OPEC, allied, oil, producing, nations, Russia, continuing, discuss, extending, current, policy, keeping, oil, production, 7, 7, million, barrels, per, day, capacity, early, 2021, least, The, bad, news, members, board, decision, Russia, particular, arguing, production, increase, 0, 5, million, barrels, per, day, early, January, 
If, Russia, gets, way, barring, immediate, uptick, global, oil, demand, expected, arrival, multiple, new, coronavirus, vaccines, oil, companies, could, see, hard, price, gains, oil, past, week, erased, matter, Investors, decision, abandon, oil, stocks, today, suggests, irrational, may, seem, chance, oil, producers, decide, increase, production, middle, glutted, market, real, risk, cannot, discounted, 
This, November, good, one, market, The, S, P, 500, logged, 11, gain, ended, reversing, losses, logged, October, well, September, In, fact, major, indices, recently, hit, record, highs, 
It, would, short, sighted, however, overlook, fact, energy, stocks, fair, share, heavy, lifting, S, P, 500, components, Occidental, Petroleum, NYSE, OXY, Devon, Energy, NYSE, DVN, Diamondback, Energy, NASDAQ, FANG, 70, November, leading, sector, rebound, rather, rough, October, plunge, In, fact, oil, gas, stocks, ripe, recovery, past, fallen, nearly, 40, June, highs, The, coronavirus, pandemic, really, rattled, surprisingly, sensitive, energy, market, 
If, thinking, rebound, marks, beginning, bigger, picture, recovery, oil, gas, names, though, may, want, reconsider, The, underlying, dynamics, sector, still, strong, enough, get, companies, meaningfully, back, black, 
Diamondback, Devon, Occidental, may, put, biggest, numbers, virtue, bigger, market, caps, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, boasted, bigger, bullish, impact, S, P, 500, They, 32, 24, respectively, November, As, crude, oil, March, short, lived, low, near, 20, per, barrel, since, improved, 45, 
The, prod, least, latter, part, gains, prospect, end, coronavirus, pandemic, On, Nov, 9, Pfizer, announced, vaccine, co, developed, BioNTech, effective, days, later, Moderna, reported, candidate, similarly, effective, vaccine, SARS, CoV, 2, infections, Even, AstraZeneca, solution, holds, promise, despite, questions, company, trial, methodology, Surely, one, finally, get, COVID, 19, control, That, ultimately, help, rekindle, need, gasoline, diesel, fuel, 
Then, simple, fact, energy, stocks, along, oil, prices, beaten, badly, October, failed, fully, recover, February, March, plunge, plenty, room, recover, 
It, still, enough, however, start, making, big, bets, long, lived, rebounds, stocks, As, enticing, gains, proven, real, staying, power, 
Yes, energy, sector, players, may, well, enjoy, higher, oil, prices, Keep, things, perspective, though, Even, crude, prices, continue, march, upward, current, price, 45, per, barrel, high, 55, per, barrel, still, line, 2019, lackluster, levels, You, may, recall, even, industry, titans, like, ExxonMobil, Occidental, exactly, fire, reporting, per, share, profits, around, half, 2018, less, Chevron, Devon, Energy, fared, little, better, virtue, posting, earnings, drops, dramatic, peers, None, companies, done, particularly, well, since, 2014, fact, West, Texas, crude, prices, around, 100, per, barrel, 
And, even, improved, price, 55, per, barrel, may, merely, pipe, dream, The, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, recent, outlook, suggests, average, price, crude, 2021, bit, 44, per, barrel, That, pessimistic, recent, price, outlook, ExxonMobil, according, The, Wall, Street, Journal, leaps, bounds, The, internal, documents, reviewed, Journal, indicate, recently, fall, ExxonMobil, cut, crude, price, outlook, next, seven, amounts, ranging, 11, 17, That, would, put, crude, prices, somewhere, 55, 60, per, barrel, seven, 
In, meantime, record, peak, 539, million, barrels, hit, July, country, collective, inventory, 488, million, barrels, still, roughly, 100, million, barrels, prior, 2015, This, degree, supply, works, oil, prices, climbed, quickly, late, 
There, also, small, matter, global, consumption, crude, leveling, couple, sink, 2019, peak, daily, consumption, 101, 5, million, barrels, even, normal, 2021, OPEC, former, head, research, Hasan, Qabazard, told, Reuters, earlier, COVID, 19, pandemic, causing, permanent, demand, destruction, oil, gas, industry, adding, would, likely, take, 2040s, far, populated, world, would, use, even, much, 110, million, barrels, per, day, 
None, suggest, oil, gas, stocks, experience, occasional, moment, brilliance, future, Oil, prices, volatile, directions, 
However, bigger, picture, underpinnings, energy, stocks, recent, rally, may, may, built, last, As, tough, watch, entire, industry, slowly, unravel, investors, would, wise, start, thinking, energy, market, midst, paradigm, shift, disfavors, fossil, fuels, Change, happens, even, driven, short, lived, headwinds, like, pandemic, Making, job, even, tougher, could, take, several, reality, become, crystal, clear, 
In, meantime, Neither, Diamondback, Chevron, ExxonMobil, recently, hot, stocks, proven, buys, anybody, speculators, swing, traders, income, investors, care, reasonably, reliable, dividends,
