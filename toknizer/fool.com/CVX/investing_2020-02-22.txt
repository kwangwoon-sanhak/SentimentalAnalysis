Oil, prices, peaked, 100, barrel, mid, 2014, falling, sharply, They, basically, moribund, since, Normally, low, energy, prices, help, weed, industry, weak, players, taking, painfully, long, time, happen, time, around, A, big, piece, problem, historically, low, interest, rate, environment, Here, need, know, plus, reason, sticking, industry, giants, remains, best, course, action, 
Oil, commodity, prone, frequent, ups, downs, In, fact, series, bull, bear, markets, oil, last, years, despite, fact, commodity, largely, stuck, 50, 60, range, time, Although, oil, prices, historically, quite, variable, something, throwing, monkey, wrench, normal, cycle, today, low, interest, rates, 
In, typical, cycle, growing, demand, eventually, outstrips, supply, oil, leads, increased, energy, prices, High, oil, prices, turn, lead, increased, spending, new, production, As, new, production, comes, online, supply, demand, imbalance, corrected, Normally, production, overshoots, demand, however, oil, prices, start, fall, often, quite, dramatically, When, happens, weakest, players, industry, generally, overextend, upturn, end, getting, flushed, system, This, take, many, forms, usually, means, bankruptcy, getting, bought, This, cycle, unique, energy, sector, commodities, work, 
The, problem, today, downside, current, cycle, playing, quite, like, It, long, drawn, increasing, pain, oil, drillers, feeling, 
Although, news, filled, stories, oil, industry, bankruptcies, supply, demand, imbalance, simply, going, away, For, starters, demand, growth, relatively, soft, conservation, weak, global, economy, But, equally, important, today, interest, rates, historically, low, demand, income, producing, securities, incredibly, high, The, upshot, even, financially, weak, companies, including, taken, turn, bankruptcy, court, still, get, financing, 
So, shakeout, normally, happens, bottom, cycle, taking, shape, quite, quickly, past, Weak, companies, limping, along, hoping, better, days, Adding, issue, fact, called, unconventional, onshore, U, S, oil, drilling, made, United, States, global, leader, oil, production, Known, fracking, method, drilling, tends, result, quick, increases, production, think, weeks, months, compared, things, like, offshore, oil, drilling, take, years, produce, results, Put, cheap, easy, money, fracking, together, every, time, oil, prices, start, rise, U, S, production, picks, puts, damper, price, increase, 
The, easy, cash, giving, weakest, players, breathing, room, typically, hang, little, longer, At, time, however, industry, giants, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, starting, move, aggressively, unconventional, oil, space, This, would, normally, case, well, financed, players, displacing, weaker, companies, time, around, The, weaker, drillers, still, game, despite, low, oil, prices, continue, get, cash, investors, fund, businesses, 
It, ugly, scenario, hard, solve, even, though, OPEC, working, curb, production, attempt, balance, supply, demand, Onshore, U, S, production, however, simply, picking, slack, oil, group, attempting, create, large, enough, shakeout, taken, shape, 
All, oil, sector, looks, like, terrible, place, invest, today, Unless, course, company, buy, financial, strength, keep, investing, environment, track, record, prove, Which, Exxon, Chevron, come, These, two, industry, giants, long, histories, navigating, oil, industry, ups, downs, relative, ease, One, place, see, dividends, increased, disbursements, annually, three, decades, Clearly, companies, know, deal, industry, downturns, still, rewarding, investors, 
XOM, DIVIDEND, YIELD, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
That, largely, focus, short, term, gyrations, instead, looking, long, term, supply, demand, dynamics, industry, They, know, company, financial, strength, muddle, downturns, often, investing, weakest, moments, thrive, upturns, To, end, Exxon, Chevron, two, strongest, balance, sheets, energy, sector, financial, debt, equity, ratios, 0, 15, times, space, would, low, number, industry, Essentially, financial, strength, take, extra, debt, downturn, without, putting, long, term, viability, risk, 
That, basically, means, Exxon, Chevron, outlast, smaller, players, take, greater, financial, risks, leveraging, balance, sheets, But, process, taking, longer, today, low, interest, rate, environment, However, good, side, creating, huge, opportunity, dividend, investors, willing, think, long, term, along, Exxon, Chevron, To, put, number, dividend, yields, 5, 7, 4, 6, respectively, near, highest, levels, last, 20, years, 
At, point, clear, solution, problems, facing, energy, sector, The, typical, boom, bust, cycle, stuck, bust, rut, easy, financially, weak, companies, raise, cash, However, history, guide, weak, names, eventually, get, flushed, system, largest, strongest, companies, survive, That, turn, allow, thrive, demand, outstrips, supply, leading, rising, oil, prices, The, coronavirus, recently, named, COVID, 19, might, industry, shock, helps, happen, since, dramatically, reduced, demand, China, led, renewed, oil, downturn, Only, time, tell, 
What, pretty, clear, however, Exxon, Chevron, survive, COVID, 19, hit, stride, With, luck, smaller, financially, weak, names, industry, And, boom, bust, cycle, get, back, typical, track, If, COVID, 19, trick, something, else, eventually, That, said, income, focused, investor, would, good, time, deep, dive, Exxon, Chevron, investors, finally, stop, throwing, money, weak, drillers,
