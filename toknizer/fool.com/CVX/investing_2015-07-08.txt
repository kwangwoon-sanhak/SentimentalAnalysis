For, investors, value, proposition, buying, shares, company, like, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
relatively, stable, investment, handles, ups, downs, commodity, cycle, without, much, trouble, pays, nice, dividend, boot, So, far, year, though, stock, bastion, stability, shares, declined, 15, 2015, close, 30, since, price, oil, started, trending, downward, August, last, year, 
While, I, say, certainty, prices, go, worth, looking, bull, bear, sides, argument, So, let, take, look, three, factors, could, keep, Chevron, stock, red, longer, 
Oil, price, weakness, takes, bigger, bite, Chevron, 
It, pretty, easy, lump, companies, like, Chevron, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
sentence, business, models, pretty, similar, small, differences, companies, make, unique, One, stands, fact, Chevron, success, much, directly, tied, exploration, production, side, business, ExxonMobil, integrated, oil, majors, The, chart, shows, much, company, revenue, comes, exploration, production, Keep, mind, revenue, numbers, earnings, 
SOURCE, LATEST, QUARTERLY, REPORTS, 
The, reason, I, using, revenue, instead, earnings, earnings, figures, vary, much, based, commodity, prices, revenue, breakdowns, segment, stay, much, consistent, quarterly, annual, basis, As, seen, Chevron, production, side, business, larger, aspect, overall, business, comparison, peers, imagine, production, side, business, suffers, oil, gas, prices, low, 
While, hard, extrapolate, quarterly, results, company, size, one, aspect, really, stuck, last, quarter, Chevron, U, S, production, operations, lost, 460, million, suggests, today, price, environment, effective, generating, return, Contrast, ExxonMobil, came, close, breakeven, U, S, operations, lost, 52, million, last, quarter, pennies, companies, size, 
With, Chevron, business, fate, tied, closer, production, side, business, weakness, generating, positive, returns, today, prices, segments, might, continue, struggle, 
Bad, timing, lackluster, LNG, market, 
Chevron, made, large, bets, LNG, exports, years, ago, expectation, demand, natural, gas, would, robust, years, come, The, one, thing, company, probably, anticipate, made, investments, U, S, places, would, become, major, player, export, game, 
Today, 54, billion, Gorgon, LNG, facility, getting, ready, ship, first, cargoes, upside, company, touch, 75, facility, capacity, long, term, purchase, agreements, The, downside, however, current, spot, price, LNG, cargoes, 7, 20, per, million, BTU, well, set, purchase, price, contracts, 10, 20, per, mmBTU, based, current, prices, Brent, oil, So, excess, capacity, could, going, already, oversupplied, market, making, returns, LNG, facilities, hoping, 
This, could, short, term, thing, since, company, anticipates, international, LNG, demand, outpace, LNG, export, facilities, operation, construction, within, decade,

That, said, continued, lull, LNG, prices, next, couple, years, could, make, LNG, bet, look, like, slam, dunk, years, ago, 
Continuing, cash, crunch, 
Over, past, couple, years, Chevron, spending, ton, money, new, devlopment, projects, notably, Gorgon, facility, big, project, bill, eating, capital, left, right, Since, beginning, 2013, capital, expenditure, budget, blown, amount, cash, coming, operations, This, pretty, stark, contrast, peers, displayed, bit, financial, discipline, kept, cash, operations, excess, capital, needs, 
SOURCE, S, P, CAPITAL, IQ, 
This, obviously, situation, happen, perpetually, Chevron, needing, either, sell, older, assets, take, debt, cover, expenditures, Granted, still, good, financial, health, AA, credit, rating, low, debt, capital, ratio, eventually, company, start, turning, cash, flow, positive, especially, since, cash, operations, expected, get, even, smaller, today, oil, prices, 
It, able, turn, corner, capital, budget, mega, projects, Gorgon, go, operational, investors, could, soon, look, cash, generation, issue, sign, weakness, look, Chevron, competitors, 
What, Fool, believes, 
Chevron, company, risk, default, anything, like, mean, immune, market, Continuously, low, oil, prices, weaker, expected, LNG, market, overambitious, spending, habit, leading, lack, cash, reasons, Chevron, stock, might, perform, well, might, hope, The, biggest, thing, investors, watch, much, spending, reduces, many, mega, projects, go, operation, This, answer, lot, questions, regarding, future, next, couple, years, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear,
