Most, people, think, investing, money, That, obviously, true, whole, story, Another, perhaps, larger, part, investing, emotions, emotions, others, Wall, Street, In, fact, one, key, takeaway, pandemic, scarred, 2020, probably, importance, patience, 
Benjamin, Graham, man, helped, train, Warren, Buffett, generally, considered, father, financial, analysis, used, interesting, metaphor, describe, Wall, Street, Paraphrasing, said, investing, like, working, partner, named, Mr, Market, Every, day, Mr, Market, would, either, offer, buy, half, business, sell, based, mood, given, moment, Some, days, excited, days, pessimistic, presenting, opportunities, buy, sell, desirable, prices, 
A, devoted, value, investor, makes, sense, Graham, would, think, investing, way, But, really, great, mental, image, regard, Wall, Street, tends, shift, emotional, extremes, The, early, 2020, bear, market, prime, example, coronavirus, pandemic, quickly, pushed, stocks, lower, investors, switch, gears, drive, stocks, higher, As, 2020, draws, close, S, P, 500, 14, almost, hard, believe, index, around, 30, one, point, early, year, 
How, rational, seesaw, year, The, answer, likely, rational, look, long, term, In, fact, many, cases, investors, would, best, taking, deep, breath, nothing, A, willingness, sit, tight, patient, paid, 
Simply, put, every, situation, calls, immediate, reaction, For, example, industrial, giant, 3M, NYSE, MMM, fell, sharply, bear, market, basically, recovered, ground, lost, Its, business, cyclical, fact, revenue, earnings, pressure, today, recession, hardly, surprising, And, nothing, dramatically, changed, historically, innovation, driven, company, suggest, stock, fallen, 30, bear, market, 
MMM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Buying, depths, downturn, probably, good, call, Selling, however, would, mistake, given, quick, recovery, fact, nothing, material, changed, 3M, In, case, key, holding, tight, understanding, To, put, perspective, 3M, debt, equity, ratio, 0, 2, covers, trailing, interest, expenses, 14, times, Financial, risk, modest, best, Moreover, six, decade, long, streak, annual, dividend, increases, belt, That, example, company, commitment, dividend, investors, also, shows, deftly, managed, many, negative, economic, cycles, Yes, COVID, 19, led, downturn, reason, worry, worth, panicking, assuming, good, handle, 3M, business, 
But, nothing, work, every, case, sectors, still, facing, material, headwinds, However, willing, patient, could, actually, opportunity, coronavirus, storm, clouds, slowly, starting, clear, 
Energy, stocks, hit, particularly, hard, pandemic, thanks, shutdowns, used, slow, spread, This, led, massive, decline, energy, demand, would, expect, steep, drops, prices, oil, natural, gas, The, thing, really, extreme, example, supply, demand, cycle, always, existed, energy, patch, If, history, guide, supply, curtailed, drillers, indeed, pulling, back, demand, eventually, pick, vaccines, vital, side, equation, The, end, result, likely, restoration, balance, higher, commodity, prices,

That, suggest, risks, highly, leveraged, drillers, already, going, bankrupt, getting, acquired, helping, clear, oversupply, situation, It, probably, best, investors, stick, even, switch, large, financially, strong, companies, sector, like, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, This, integrated, energy, giant, leverage, modest, capital, spending, needs, relatively, low, It, able, muddle, downturn, relative, stride, In, fact, made, acquisition, Chevron, likely, come, side, cycle, stronger, company, entered, 
When, step, back, try, learn, 2020, lesson, probably, take, heart, avoid, like, Mr, Market, That, means, controlling, emotions, enough, think, long, term, even, stocks, volatile, In, short, need, patient, Industrial, giant, 3M, example, since, sitting, pat, nothing, good, call, current, shareholders, That, said, upheaval, market, still, presenting, opportunities, integrated, oil, major, Chevron, shows, In, end, want, keep, cool, use, Mr, Market, emotional, whims, advantage,
