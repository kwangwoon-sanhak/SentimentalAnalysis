With, U, S, dollar, gaining, ground, every, currency, worries, growing, foreign, exchange, rates, take, bite, companies, profits, Many, different, sectors, affected, various, ways, particularly, ones, deal, global, commodities, like, found, energy, space, 
In, honesty, though, companies, operating, natural, gas, industry, least, ones, I, would, likely, invest, affected, foreign, exchanges, risks, Let, look, case, 
What, stake, 
One, risk, faced, companies, international, operations, local, currency, sell, products, equate, price, revenue, converted, back, U, S, dollars, The, companies, foreign, exchange, risk, natural, gas, space, today, integrated, oil, gas, companies, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
Both, produce, sell, large, volumes, natural, gas, outside, United, States, headquarters, U, S, therefore, accounting, based, U, S, dollars, 
ExxonMobil, break, foreign, exchange, losses, segment, segment, foreign, exchange, rates, led, loss, 340, million, last, quarter, 7, earnings, Conversely, Chevron, exploration, production, segment, gained, 522, million, favorable, foreign, exchange, rates, 20, boost, 
This, makes, foreign, exchange, complicated, comes, natural, gas, sold, internationally, depends, immensely, company, generating, revenue, One, would, assume, two, companies, large, global, natural, gas, players, impacted, similar, fashions, foreign, exchange, rates, The, numbers, indicate, strongly, might, always, case, 
Homegrown, production, homegrown, revenue, 
Normally, talk, commodities, think, global, products, Basic, materials, oil, iron, ore, copper, move, fluidly, around, world, without, many, restrictions, priced, global, scale, perhaps, small, regional, discrepancies, based, transportation, costs, 
Natural, gas, hand, commodity, without, free, flowing, international, market, Pretty, much, way, economically, transport, something, gaseous, state, pipeline, move, materials, land, shorter, distances, underwater, Across, ocean, Forget, Currently, way, natural, gas, economically, moved, one, continent, another, cryogenically, processing, liquid, state, shipping, refrigerated, tankers, The, costs, liquefy, transport, regassify, natural, gas, normally, greater, cost, feedstock, product, 
This, means, domestic, natural, gas, companies, aside, significant, international, presence, ExxonMobil, Chevron, sell, significant, volumes, gas, foreign, countries, Only, 4, U, S, produced, gas, sold, Canada, Mexico, combined, 2014, via, pipeline, date, LNG, export, facilities, running, So, minor, exceptions, gas, produced, United, States, sold, market, buys, U, S, dollars, making, foreign, exchange, minimal, cost, 
What, LNG, companies, When, start, export, 
This, question, probably, mind, investors, stake, Cheniere, Energy, NYSEMKT, LNG, 
since, entire, future, income, stream, geared, toward, selling, natural, gas, around, world, Here, nice, part, Very, little, business, risk, foreign, exchange, issues, large, portion, revenue, stream, tied, fixed, fee, contracts, processing, handling, natural, gas, various, customers, Also, commodity, price, related, risk, contracts, based, known, Henry, Hub, spot, price, pricing, hub, United, States, denominated, U, S, dollars, 
SOURCE, CHENIERE, ENERGY, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
One, small, part, Cheniere, business, marketing, trading, arm, exposed, foreign, exchange, rates, This, part, business, deliver, sell, LNG, various, trading, hubs, around, world, prices, gas, could, influenced, foreign, exchange, rates, However, Cheniere, projects, less, 20, LNG, volumes, sold, way, significantly, limiting, foreign, exchange, risk, 
Other, companies, plans, export, LNG, U, S, largely, looking, establish, contracts, like, Cheniere, denominated, U, S, dollars, account, vast, majority, production, capacity, These, measures, help, prevent, foreign, exchange, taking, big, bite, companies, potential, earnings, 
What, Fool, believes, 
Foreign, exchange, rates, tricky, thing, wrap, head, around, dealing, commodities, rates, vary, quite, bit, depending, company, works, However, since, natural, gas, hard, move, internationally, well, gas, U, S, based, natural, gas, investments, significant, exposure, foreign, exchange, risk, Besides, much, important, things, consider, investing, natural, gas,
