Luckily, Exxon, refining, business, helped, pad, margins, despite, segments, profits, falling, 2, 6, Overall, Exxon, able, grow, earnings, 50, million, year, year, While, might, sound, like, lot, expert, share, repurchaser, represented, 6, earnings, growth, per, share, basis, 
Unfortunately, Chevron, lucky, integrated, business, affected, downtime, two, refineries, The, company, Richmond, Calif, plant, since, last, August, fire, Pascagoula, Miss, plant, experienced, preannounced, maintenance, quarter, What, meant, Chevron, upstream, earnings, fell, 6, 17, billion, 5, 52, billion, year, year, problem, compounded, downstream, earnings, slipped, 804, million, 701, million, Together, contributed, earnings, drop, 3, per, share, 
What, seeing, quarter, Exxon, integrated, asset, base, really, helped, bail, Chevron, That, rather, interesting, considering, Exxon, vocal, exporting, LNG, would, affect, chemicals, side, business,
