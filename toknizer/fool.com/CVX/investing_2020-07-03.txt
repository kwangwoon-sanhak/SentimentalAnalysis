Essentially, energy, sector, attempting, adjust, increase, U, S, production, years, amounted, little, bit, much, supply, floating, around, When, COVID, 19, hit, however, things, took, drastic, turn, worse, The, global, effort, slow, spread, coronavirus, via, rapid, economic, shutdowns, removed, material, amount, demand, tipping, supply, demand, equation, deeply, balance, In, fact, one, point, oil, prices, actually, fell, zero, There, complicated, technical, reasons, brief, moment, time, oil, drillers, effectively, paying, customers, take, oil, 
With, companies, upstream, drilling, downstream, chemicals, refining, areas, sector, getting, hit, energy, names, pulling, back, hard, The, biggest, moves, cut, capital, spending, plans, ensure, enough, cash, hand, survive, market, recovers, Chevron, working, hard, company, fronts, current, environment, actually, allowing, show, many, strengths, 
Coming, current, downturn, Chevron, one, modest, capital, investment, plans, relative, cash, flow, closest, peers, It, benefiting, past, spending, however, still, expecting, production, grow, healthy, 3, 4, annualized, pace, When, demand, fell, sharply, company, pulled, back, spending, plans, roughly, 20, billion, year, 14, billion, This, impact, production, today, prices, oil, probably, better, left, ground, pulled, sold, cheaply, The, point, Chevron, able, take, already, conservative, posturing, become, even, conservative, 
But, really, big, story, shows, oil, giant, balance, sheet, The, company, long, term, debt, load, increased, huge, 20, first, quarter, 2020, That, massive, uptick, short, period, time, normally, would, sign, investors, needed, start, worrying, However, put, figure, broader, context, industry, actually, makes, Chevron, stand, good, way, 
For, example, Chevron, increase, notable, biggest, sector, U, S, peer, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, increased, long, term, debt, tally, 30, could, continue, support, aggressive, counter, cyclical, investment, program, This, important, point, comparison, two, U, S, companies, tend, carry, less, debt, European, counterparts, generally, debt, higher, cash, balances, They, interchangeable, balance, sheet, approaches,

When, times, get, tough, like, today, already, heavy, debt, load, make, adding, even, debt, undesirable, And, using, cash, cushion, liquidity, key, goal, also, problematic, Thus, Chevron, Exxon, modest, levels, debt, able, tap, strength, balance, sheets, tough, period, ensuring, liquidity, needed, survive, highly, cyclical, industry, headwinds, However, even, increasing, long, term, debt, load, 20, single, quarter, Chevron, financial, debt, equity, ratio, reasonable, 0, 25, times, still, lowest, closest, peers, Sure, number, roughly, double, 0, 12, times, start, year, highlights, well, positioned, conservative, oil, company, coming, downturn, 
When, put, together, Chevron, entered, downturn, fairly, strong, position, When, downturn, hit, able, pull, back, already, relatively, modest, spending, plans, tap, rock, solid, balance, sheet, still, maintaining, industry, leading, leverage, profile, It, likely, best, positioned, oil, major, planet, today, With, generous, 5, 7, yield, investors, looking, energy, sector, bargains, put, Chevron, short, lists,
