When, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, reported, fourth, quarter, 2020, earnings, CEO, Mike, Wirth, described, unprecedented, year, That, understatement, given, oil, prices, actually, fell, zero, one, point, But, oil, giant, muddled, strongly, positioned, benefit, oil, prices, rebound, Here, key, points, consider, looking, integrated, energy, giant, fat, 5, 8, dividend, yield, 
The, one, place, Chevron, shines, particularly, bright, balance, sheet, Although, company, yet, file, annual, report, ended, third, quarter, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, 0, 26, times, lowest, peer, group, The, closest, competitor, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, ratio, 0, 39, times, The, key, however, two, companies, actually, traded, places, Historically, Exxon, better, debt, equity, ratio, 2020, energy, industry, downturn, changed, big, way, company, heavy, capital, spending, plans, 
To, fair, neither, company, bad, position, financially, speaking, Chevron, simply, leeway, lean, balance, sheet, times, remain, tough, That, huge, advantage, many, reasons, The, company, able, continue, supporting, dividend, capital, spending, plans, even, taking, advantage, external, opportunities, 
That, brings, us, second, point, Chevron, used, downturn, buy, Noble, Drilling, The, total, deal, value, roughly, 13, billion, including, around, 8, billion, worth, debt, Chevron, balance, sheet, strength, allowed, take, deal, like, industry, downturn, But, real, key, oil, giant, able, opportunistically, use, unprecedented, downturn, strengthen, long, term, position, industry, 
However, another, important, factor, well, At, end, 2019, Chevron, looking, buy, Anadarko, Petroleum, outbid, Occidental, Petroleum, Chevron, walked, away, thought, price, got, high, The, deal, turned, poorly, timed, Occidental, evidence, Chevron, disciplined, approach, since, chose, get, bidding, war, In, words, investors, pretty, confident, Chevron, overreach, Noble, 
In, addition, facts, Chevron, able, pull, back, hard, capital, spending, plans, 2020, The, final, tally, 35, 2019, figure, But, roughly, 13, billion, energy, company, spent, also, company, pandemic, revised, projections, 14, billion, So, company, able, quickly, adjust, industry, upheaval, For, comparison, Exxon, spent, 21, billion, 
Despite, pullback, spending, Chevron, production, rose, 1, 2020, helped, purchase, Noble, Meanwhile, Exxon, production, fell, nearly, 5, So, despite, industry, headwinds, reduced, spending, Chevron, finding, way, keep, growing, business, closest, peer, balance, sheet, wise, trying, muddle, 
All, good, news, however, juxtaposed, obvious, negative, Although, oil, prices, heading, higher, early, 2021, times, back, normal, stretch, imagination, To, put, numbers, fourth, quarter, 2020, Chevron, reported, adjusted, loss, penny, share, full, year, adjusted, loss, 0, 20, per, share, But, include, one, time, items, like, 4, 5, billion, write, company, took, full, year, loss, painful, 2, 96, per, share, Chevron, took, larger, one, time, charge, 8, 7, billion, 2019, higher, oil, prices, offset, hit, company, earning, 1, 54, per, share, 
The, higher, oil, prices, seen, far, 2021, help, get, earnings, moving, better, path, Chevron, reports, break, even, point, 55, per, barrel, That, low, number, relative, peers, means, Chevron, really, needs, oil, stay, current, range, recently, surpassed, 60, per, barrel, 2021, another, difficult, year, The, problem, course, global, pandemic, unknowable, So, looks, like, oil, inventories, heading, lower, demand, slowly, returning, dynamics, could, easily, change, negative, based, new, variants, novel, illness, 
When, step, back, look, big, picture, Chevron, probably, best, positioned, oil, company, today, given, strong, financial, position, relatively, low, spending, needs, ability, take, advantage, downturn, bolster, industry, position, Given, uncertainty, still, exists, investors, looking, energy, sector, like, see, And, wait, industry, rebound, collect, generous, 5, 8, dividend, yield, backed, 30, years, annual, dividend, increases,
