Integrated, oil, giant, Chevron, Corporation, NYSE, CVX, ignoring, environmental, impact, oil, natural, gas, realizes, global, warming, real, issue, But, also, operate, world, exists, today, And, means, Chevron, still, needs, produce, carbon, fuels, something, expects, many, years, come, Here, 
If, die, hard, environmentalist, even, steadfast, ESG, investor, might, OK, oil, industry, facing, hard, times, After, oil, companies, like, Chevron, produce, dirty, fuels, make, global, warming, worse, But, talk, CEOs, companies, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, B, get, slightly, different, story, Recently, Chevron, CEO, Michael, Wirth, offered, thoughts, matter,

In, interview, CNBC, Wirth, asked, specifically, future, oil, leading, explain, 
There, long, future, growth, environment, long, future, even, environment, begins, plateau, good, economic, investment, continue, provide, affordable, reliable, ever, cleaner, energy, world, need, 
This, much, different, Exxon, Shell, saying, Exxon, example, confident, future, oil, natural, gas, doubling, exploration, efforts, Shell, hedging, bets, dipping, toes, electricity, space, CEO, Ben, van, Beurden, recently, explained, Reuters, interview, Despite, lot, activists, say, entirely, legitimate, invest, oil, gas, world, demands, 
With, world, increasingly, concerned, global, warming, CEOs, still, positive, The, answer, simpler, might, think, 
First, oil, giants, ignorant, issue, global, warming, As, noted, Shell, investing, electricity, space, Exxon, experimenting, algae, produced, fuel, way, help, world, reduce, carbon, emissions, And, oil, giants, following, along, Chevron, working, ways, reduce, emissions, produces, drilling, oil, natural, gas, In, fact, set, environmental, goals, target, flaring, burning, excess, natural, gas, methane, emissions, using, renewables, power, drilling, efforts, among, things, To, even, skeptics, oil, majors, making, token, effort, good, environmental, stewards, 
While, might, think, ceasing, produce, oil, natural, gas, altogether, would, best, way, achieve, pragmatic, For, example, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, states, based, existing, policy, intentions, targets, oil, demand, likely, peak, least, 2040, To, fair, growth, robust, IEA, predicting, mid, 2020s, 2040, demand, growth, slows, crawl, But, demand, keep, rising, even, world, puts, place, current, environmental, plans, 
Only, exactly, things, shaping, since, many, countries, around, world, actually, falling, short, environmental, goals, commitments, So, unless, countries, get, really, serious, carbon, reduction, future, oil, likely, pretty, robust, 
The, story, even, better, natural, gas, used, transition, fuel, utility, sector, burns, cleanly, coal, That, said, IEA, estimates, missed, mark, past, underestimating, renewable, power, growth, rates, It, currently, offering, another, scenario, oil, natural, gas, nearly, well, But, scenario, requires, exceeding, environmental, goals, exist, today, Based, current, success, rates, seems, unlikely, 
There, two, big, problems, The, first, infrastructure, support, oil, natural, gas, place, pervasive, huge, You, replace, oil, natural, gas, overnight, It, takes, time, money, effort, likely, multi, decade, endeavor, At, time, world, population, continues, grow, largely, driven, emerging, markets, meaning, need, energy, One, form, energy, unlikely, able, support, world, energy, needs, meaning, even, carbon, based, fuels, still, important, place, table, While, clean, energy, likely, displace, oil, natural, gas, time, chance, wholesale, shift, next, couple, decades, seems, remote, given, current, set, circumstances, 
CVX, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
But, demand, half, story, The, side, equation, supply, Oil, natural, gas, depleting, assets, Once, barrel, pulled, ground, gone, forever, If, energy, companies, world, stopped, looking, new, oil, natural, gas, replace, currently, producing, future, production, would, plummet, This, driller, replacement, rate, important, shows, well, company, replacing, produces, 2013, 2017, Chevron, replacement, rate, bit, 100, one, best, rates, closest, peers, 
The, big, takeaway, however, oil, natural, gas, companies, need, keep, drilling, order, produce, energy, world, continues, demand, So, drilling, business, simply, end, companies, like, Chevron, need, keep, world, would, fall, woefully, short, oil, natural, gas, So, least, Chevron, core, exploration, business, supported, supply, demand, issues, While, way, tell, future, bring, Chevron, Wirth, appears, spot, says, long, future, ahead, oil, natural, gas, companies, produce, 
It, hard, long, term, investors, get, beyond, Wall, Street, whims, Today, ESG, investing, headline, grabbing, investment, approach, look, kindly, oil, natural, gas, companies, like, Chevron, even, though, remain, vital, cogs, global, economic, machine, With, roughly, 4, dividend, yield, decades, annual, dividend, increases, strong, balance, sheet, Chevron, solid, option, dividend, focused, investors, willing, take, contrarian, view, The, core, view, meanwhile, something, major, energy, CEOs, trying, explain, pretty, simple, Carbon, fuels, dead, yet,
