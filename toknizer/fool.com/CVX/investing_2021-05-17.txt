The, energy, sector, teetering, 2020, massive, demand, drop, caused, pandemic, response, left, oil, prices, languishing, Some, energy, companies, including, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, B, made, huge, business, shifts, others, like, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, chose, stay, course, So, far, Chevron, approach, appears, better, option, dividend, investors, And, likely, remain, case, long, time, come, 
Energy, companies, facing, hard, times, 2020, low, oil, prices, heavy, debt, loads, forcing, drillers, pull, back, spending, plans, When, pandemic, hit, things, got, even, worse, key, U, S, oil, benchmark, West, Texas, Intermediate, crude, falling, zero, one, point, Think, second, drillers, paying, customers, take, oil, hands, brief, moment, time, There, unique, factors, involved, prices, quickly, bounced, back, statement, difficult, market, time, 
Add, ongoing, shift, toward, cleaner, fuels, energy, companies, decided, time, make, drastic, changes, For, example, last, year, Royal, Dutch, Shell, announced, would, aggressively, transition, business, toward, low, carbon, future, It, exactly, new, direction, since, company, investing, clean, energy, years, However, change, effort, expected, intensify, materially, At, time, Shell, cut, dividend, huge, 66, partly, reduce, debt, partly, make, easier, fund, capital, investment, plans, It, looked, like, company, hitting, reset, button, The, dividend, since, increased, twice, roughly, four, percent, time, materially, lower, base, 
It, likely, Royal, Dutch, Shell, keep, raising, new, lower, dividend, works, shift, gears, That, unattractive, option, investors, though, comes, yield, 3, 6, lowest, integrated, energy, peer, group, And, clear, yet, investing, renewable, power, provide, returns, company, cash, cow, oil, natural, gas, businesses, In, fact, companies, operating, renewables, space, question, prices, paid, assets, today, describing, frothy, specifically, pulled, back, bidding, new, clean, energy, projects, Higher, project, prices, generally, mean, lower, long, term, returns, 
Royal, Dutch, Shell, might, right, direction, new, approach, still, might, work, well, hoped, company, find, financially, attractive, ways, put, money, work, 
Which, brings, us, Chevron, integrated, energy, giant, dipping, toes, clean, energy, yet, looking, make, big, shift, away, oil, natural, gas, The, stock, yield, around, 4, 8, today, near, lower, end, peer, group, full, percentage, point, higher, Shell, offering, And, Chevron, increased, dividend, annually, 25, consecutive, years, making, Dividend, Aristocrat, 
But, really, interesting, thing, Chevron, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, 34, That, lowest, peers, Shell, debt, equity, ratio, nearly, twice, high, around, 63, To, fair, Shell, tends, carry, lot, cash, balance, sheet, Chevron, However, tough, times, hit, using, cash, cushion, great, option, reduces, financial, flexibility, adding, new, debt, troubling, Chevron, low, debt, approach, gives, ample, room, lean, balance, sheet, times, tough, exactly, 2020, 
RDS, B, DEBT, TO, EQUITY, RATIO, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Chevron, financial, strength, allowed, make, sizable, acquisition, 2020, So, basically, used, downturn, last, year, make, stronger, company, That, power, financial, strength, afford, 
But, pays, take, notion, one, step, When, time, comes, reason, Chevron, simply, put, financial, strength, good, use, buying, company, renewable, power, focus, And, one, fell, swoop, would, shift, portfolio, There, shortage, options, clean, energy, space, prices, lofty, today, If, investors, sour, sector, far, fetched, expectation, given, mercurial, nature, Wall, Street, Chevron, could, even, end, buying, space, cheap, waiting, 
Meanwhile, world, continues, need, oil, natural, gas, And, demand, likely, remain, strong, years, come, since, energy, transitions, take, time, play, Indeed, renewable, power, growing, quickly, increasing, global, demand, kinds, power, likely, keep, demand, oil, natural, gas, growing, 2030, according, International, Energy, Association, Even, demand, plateaus, depleting, nature, wells, means, drilling, needed, maintain, production, In, words, looks, like, plenty, time, Chevron, keep, bleeding, cash, cow, oil, operations, 
Shell, materially, improved, dividend, paying, ability, cutting, dividend, huge, 66, Chevron, dividend, paying, ability, remains, strong, thanks, industry, leading, financial, strength, However, read, Shell, undertaking, huge, corporate, shift, time, renewable, power, sector, hot, Chevron, biding, time, sticking, knows, preserving, financial, firepower, 
At, point, Chevron, likely, put, balance, sheet, work, renewables, space, opportunistic, 2020, energy, investment, suggests, probably, wait, deals, better, Unless, believe, oil, deathbed, right, Chevron, wait, see, approach, looks, attractive, compared, Shell, big, corporate, makeover, notably, higher, yield, incredible, dividend, track, record,
