Despite, fairly, large, onshore, acquisitions, past, years, big, oil, largely, remained, sidelines, comes, shale, oil, gas, boom, When, investors, talk, Bakken, Eagle, Ford, names, near, top, list, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
Instead, smaller, independent, producers, like, Continental, Resources, NYSE, CLR,

using, plays, deliver, unbelievable, production, growth, 
At, first, glance, production, growth, numbers, quite, startling, Exxon, example, struggled, even, grow, production, It, used, massive, share, buybacks, order, grow, production, per, share, however, overall, production, growing, rather, anemic, 1, annually, Contrast, Continental, planning, grow, production, 38, 40, year, alone, Meanwhile, EOG, Resources, expected, deliver, best, class, crude, oil, growth, 2017, top, 38, compound, annual, growth, rate, seen, past, seven, years, Clearly, shale, revolution, really, effect, two, companies, 
However, important, see, companies, growing, low, base, means, shale, plays, able, make, impact, For, example, Continental, production, last, quarter, 140, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, EOG, daily, production, 214, 400, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, Exxon, oil, equivalent, production, declining, 1, 9, quarter, still, 4, million, barrels, oil, per, day, Meanwhile, Chevron, averaged, 2, 58, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, production, per, day, last, quarter, The, problem, companies, run, law, large, numbers, making, much, harder, grow, production, 
It, also, much, harder, two, companies, grow, way, onshore, shale, assets, For, example, would, take, Exxon, equivalent, production, 5, 000, onshore, wells, equal, production, one, deepwater, well, This, gushers, produce, upwards, 10, 000, 15, 000, barrels, oil, per, day, shale, wells, trickle, hundred, barrels, oil, per, day, Again, perspective, EOG, Continental, deliver, high, double, digit, production, growth, drilling, hundred, onshore, wells, per, year, even, lower, rates, 
Even, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, 
one, largest, independents, yet, shed, offshore, assets, meaningful, long, term, production, growth, delivered, It, true, Conoco, expects, double, digit, production, growth, Eagle, Ford, Bakken, positions, next, years, However, company, still, investing, heavily, offshore, areas, North, Sea, well, exploring, deep, waters, Angola, Gulf, Mexico, drive, longer, term, production, growth, Recent, discoveries, plays, suggest, plan, invest, offshore, pay, big, time, road, 
The, shale, plays, really, changed, game, U, S, oil, gas, production, However, shale, plays, simply, large, enough, drive, production, growth, big, oil, companies, need, grow, much, larger, base, This, big, oil, part, looking, offshore, deliver, production, growth,
