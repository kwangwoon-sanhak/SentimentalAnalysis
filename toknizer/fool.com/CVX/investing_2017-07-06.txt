Every, day, Wall, Street, analysts, upgrade, stocks, downgrade, others, initiate, coverage, But, analysts, even, know, talking, Today, taking, one, high, profile, Wall, Street, pick, putting, microscope, 
After, touching, 43, last, month, oil, prices, rebounded, somewhat, first, week, July, recently, approaching, 46, Thursday, per, barrel, West, Texas, Intermediate, crude, oil, WTI, Now, might, think, good, news, oil, stocks, But, think, Wall, Street, thinks, wrong, 
Despite, rebound, prices, morning, two, major, investment, banks, released, negative, notes, assortment, oil, stocks, In, rapid, fire, succession, first, RBC, Capital, cut, rating, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, underperform, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, sector, perform, Then, Bernstein, added, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, list, cutting, rating, market, perform, 
Here, three, things, need, know, 
Let, begin, beginning, day, first, oil, downgrade, Chevron, Chevron, stock, currently, costs, 104, change, RBC, previous, price, target, 112, per, share, appeared, leave, room, upside, 
No, longer, As, today, RBC, believes, Chevron, stock, worth, 100, zero, room, upside, 
In, note, covered, StreetInsider, com, requires, subscription, morning, RBC, worries, ramping, production, Permian, basin, create, drag, free, cash, flow, Chevron, siphoning, operating, cash, flow, pay, capital, investments, In, RBC, view, prevent, Chevron, generating, meaningful, free, cash, flow, Permian, operations, least, next, couple, years, FCF, actually, start, looking, good, Chevron, 2020, 
For, record, far, RBC, seems, right, Although, Chevron, reporting, positive, GAAP, profits, days, data, S, P, Global, Market, Intelligence, confirm, Chevron, free, cash, flow, still, running, negative, past, four, straight, years, 
The, situation, ExxonMobil, bit, trickier, RBC, cut, rating, Exxon, one, notch, morning, cut, price, target, 1, 95, share, Of, course, Exxon, stock, currently, costing, 80, 50, per, share, RBC, new, price, target, actually, implies, Exxon, stock, could, go, another, 18, Add, Exxon, market, beating, 3, 8, dividend, yield, works, potential, profits, nearly, 22, new, investors, seems, like, would, pretty, nice, haul, 
So, RBC, downgrade, Exxon, stock, That, good, question, I, see, clear, answer, I, suspect, even, RBC, may, recognize, rosy, scenario, likely, play, As, explained, write, TheFly, com, today, Exxon, strong, free, cash, flow, 11, billion, past, 12, months, 10, higher, reported, net, income, already, fully, reflected, stock, price, Valued, free, cash, flow, Exxon, 341, billion, market, cap, works, whopping, 31, times, free, cash, flow, already, 
Unless, Exxon, free, cash, flow, grows, whole, lot, I, honestly, see, 95, stock, price, Exxon, future, anytime, soon, For, reason, I, focusing, fact, RBC, downgraded, stock, today, reluctance, cut, price, target, much, I, think, warranted, 
Rounding, list, oil, downgrades, today, ConocoPhillips, Bernstein, RBC, playing, villain, time, According, Bernstein, ConocoPhillips, diversified, oil, producer, But, sounds, like, compliment, Bernstein, estimation, diversification, virtue, Conoco, 
Harking, back, RBC, comments, Permian, shale, region, Bernstein, notes, Conoco, Permian, interests, analyst, expects, see, strong, growth, Conoco, Permian, assets, going, forward, Unfortunately, Conoco, also, lot, interests, outside, Permian, region, Bernstein, worries, production, elsewhere, flattish, ConocoPhillips, 
The, analyst, conclusion, Investors, opt, names, heavily, levered, US, Onshore, especially, Permian, rather, diversified, names, like, COP, 
Cheap, shale, oil, upended, economics, among, oil, companies, dire, results, many, oil, majors, On, Thursday, oil, investor, Andy, Hall, Astenbeck, Capital, hedge, fund, told, Financial, Times, Opec, attempts, push, prices, 60, seem, futile, light, low, cost, producing, shale, oil, When, cost, production, cheap, rise, price, oil, tends, quickly, attract, increased, production, grows, oil, supplies, pushes, prices, right, back, 
Bernstein, particular, predicts, Brent, crude, usually, couple, dollars, expensive, U, S, West, Texas, Intermediate, rise, price, still, average, 50, year, In, opinion, Wall, Street, simply, high, enough, price, justify, 33, 6, P, E, ratio, Exxon, stock, currently, carries, much, less, 67, 8, P, E, Chevron, nonexistent, P, E, ratio, result, negative, profits, ConocoPhillips, 
Suffice, say, I, agree, Cheap, oil, high, stock, prices, mean, nothing, good, oil, stocks,
