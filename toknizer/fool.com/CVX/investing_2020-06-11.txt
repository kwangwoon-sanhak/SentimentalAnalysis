That, bad, news, good, news, factor, comes, Generally, speaking, pulling, back, capital, spending, means, slower, production, growth, oil, companies, For, onshore, U, S, driller, quickly, lead, production, declines, So, terrible, onshore, U, S, drillers, number, rigs, operating, United, States, today, near, historic, lows, This, small, issue, current, active, rig, count, 80, peak, levels, seen, 2012, 
Drillers, pulling, back, hard, material, implications, individual, businesses, But, cash, flow, weak, low, oil, prices, really, much, choice, Indeed, companies, U, S, onshore, space, already, going, bankrupt, likely, follow, 
However, big, picture, point, view, fast, growing, U, S, production, one, factors, led, oversupply, oil, first, place, So, material, pullback, onshore, drilling, actually, help, speed, process, getting, supply, demand, back, balance, Add, OPEC, production, cuts, outlook, starts, look, even, brighter, supply, side, things, On, demand, side, still, lot, excess, oil, sitting, storage, work, economies, around, world, starting, reopen, need, oil, getting, back, normal, levels, So, steep, drop, drilling, bad, news, one, hand, exactly, oil, market, needs, 
As, watch, news, energy, sector, careful, think, long, term, supply, demand, equation, like, energy, giants, That, matters, really, determine, good, news, bad, news, On, score, drop, drilling, U, S, key, source, oversupply, global, market, good, news, even, means, likely, shake, sector, In, fact, bankruptcies, might, actually, benefit, foster, rational, long, term, drilling, plans, On, negative, side, want, watch, material, uptick, energy, prices, leading, material, uptick, U, S, drilling, could, start, brand, new, cycle, All, investor, today, probably, focus, attention, companies, proven, manage, volatile, periods, like, like, integrated, giants,
