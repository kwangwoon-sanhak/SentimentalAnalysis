Gasoline, consumption, begin, shrink, year, year, basis, 2026, says, energy, consultancy, Woods, Mackenzie, subsidiary, Verisk, Analytics, That, gives, oil, industry, nine, years, find, alternative, fill, looming, void, 
So, oil, producers, turn, 
One, area, focus, companies, like, Chevron, ExxonMobil, petrochemical, production, due, growing, global, demand, high, quality, plastics, 
A, key, ingredient, plastics, used, industries, automotive, packaging, various, consumer, goods, polyethylene, And, critical, feedstock, polyethylene, may, guessed, ethylene, Thankfully, U, S, energy, producers, ethane, cracked, natural, gas, primary, source, ethylene, 
Total, global, polyethylene, production, 2018, expected, fall, shy, 100, million, tons, However, believe, demand, could, eclipse, 120, million, tons, per, year, 2026,
