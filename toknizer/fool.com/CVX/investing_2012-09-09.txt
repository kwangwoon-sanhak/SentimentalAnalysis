Bulls, pulled, stops, stock, market, responded, moving, multiyear, highs, Last, week, move, European, Central, Bank, address, sovereign, debt, crisis, setting, framework, buying, government, bonds, exactly, effect, intended, European, stocks, soared, rest, world, followed, optimism, least, one, global, macroeconomic, stresses, plagued, investors, may, disappear, near, term, As, result, Dow, Jones, Industrials, INDEX, DJI, gained, 250, points, last, two, days, week, 
As, expect, though, market, fairly, lofty, levels, investors, concerned, stocks, getting, expensive, After, three, half, year, run, Dow, doubled, even, considering, dividends, many, held, market, meltdown, earned, back, money, lost, 2008, bear, market, But, earnings, also, improved, look, closely, whether, improved, enough, justify, massive, rise, stock, prices,
