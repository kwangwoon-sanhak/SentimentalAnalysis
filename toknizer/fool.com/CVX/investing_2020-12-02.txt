Energy, stocks, largely, favor, several, years, A, global, glut, oil, gas, supply, sent, energy, stocks, reeling, The, situation, went, bad, worse, demand, destruction, due, COVID, 19, pandemic, However, recent, developments, provide, glimmer, hope, grim, situation, Here, three, reasons, could, great, idea, consider, energy, stocks, right, 
The, double, whammy, squeezed, demand, oversupplied, market, marred, energy, stocks, recent, years, However, things, look, upbeat, fronts, The, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, expects, global, consumption, petroleum, products, increase, 98, 8, million, barrels, per, day, bpd, 2021, Though, still, lower, average, 101, 5, million, bpd, 2019, expected, consumption, 2021, significantly, higher, average, 92, 9, million, bpd, 2020, Of, course, rising, coronavirus, cases, U, S, several, European, countries, could, delay, demand, recovery, 
On, supply, side, EIA, forecasts, U, S, crude, oil, production, fall, 12, 2, million, bpd, 2019, 11, 4, million, bpd, 2020, It, expects, average, production, 11, 1, million, bpd, 2021, The, expected, fall, production, due, reduced, drilling, activity, enough, offset, declines, existing, wells, The, EIA, expects, activity, production, pick, second, half, 2021, 
Globally, Organization, Petroleum, Exporting, Countries, OPEC, partner, countries, considering, extending, production, cuts, The, talks, could, surely, fall, extending, cuts, seems, rational, step, considering, rising, COVID, 19, cases, threatening, destroy, fragile, demand, recovery, 
Another, factor, driven, investors, away, energy, stocks, fear, renewable, sources, energy, replacing, oil, gas, energy, sources, Indeed, share, renewable, sources, global, energy, consumption, rising, expected, continue, 
However, total, energy, needs, also, expected, rise, This, means, even, though, oil, gas, may, contribute, lower, percentage, terms, global, energy, demand, absolute, use, still, grow, The, International, Energy, Agency, foresees, rising, global, oil, demand, well, beyond, 2040, policies, presently, effect, 
Similarly, U, S, EIA, expects, U, S, natural, gas, production, increase, 2050, It, projects, 1, 9, per, year, growth, natural, gas, production, 2020, 2025, EIA, projections, reliable, indicators, recent, years, evidence, support, Growing, global, population, rising, standards, living, especially, developing, countries, Asia, expected, drive, energy, demand, higher, This, met, combination, various, energy, sources, oil, gas, continuing, play, important, role, 
Though, energy, stocks, rallied, November, still, significantly, highs, year, Among, energy, stocks, integrated, oil, giant, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, looks, attractive, The, stock, 20, high, 2020, Chevron, strong, balance, sheet, low, production, costs, places, company, well, eventual, recovery,
