The, Marcellus, Shale, extends, upstate, New, York, south, much, Pennsylvania, virtually, West, Virginia, believed, hold, enough, natural, gas, meet, entire, energy, needs, United, States, least, 20, years, Because, vast, resource, producers, flocked, unlock, natural, gas, trapped, within, tight, rock, formations, That, said, dozens, companies, drilling, Marcellus, five, particular, dominating, thanks, strong, positions, core, play, 
The, Marcellus, Formation, encompasses, 104, 000, square, miles, throughout, Appalachian, region, While, geologists, known, Marcellus, decades, extraction, industry, radar, exploitable, energy, resource, early, 2000s, In, 2002, U, S, Geological, Survey, put, assessment, undiscovered, oil, gas, resources, Appalachian, Basin, calculating, contained, much, 1, 9, trillion, cubic, feet, natural, gas, roughly, enough, gas, meet, entire, energy, needs, 1, 9, million, homes, next, 15, years, While, lot, earth, shattering, number, 
Then, year, later, natural, gas, driller, Range, Resources, NYSE, RRC, started, experimenting, Marcellus, using, combination, horizontal, drilling, hydraulic, fracturing, extraction, techniques, proved, successful, unlocking, gas, trapped, within, Texas, Barnett, Shale, Range, first, well, began, producing, 2005, early, success, ignited, drilling, boom, Pennsylvania, 
As, producers, unleashed, torrent, natural, gas, Marcellus, tight, rocks, led, geoscientists, ratchet, estimates, play, potential, According, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, latest, assessment, Marcellus, central, corridor, contains, 143, 8, trillion, cubic, feet, technically, recoverable, natural, gas, estimates, peg, number, high, 480, trillion, cubic, feet, 
The, Marcellus, quick, rise, prominence, remarkable, It, largest, natural, gas, field, country, producing, fifth, nation, output, Driving, stunning, ascent, according, research, Pittsburgh, Business, Times, five, dominant, producers,

It, probably, surprise, see, Range, Resources, top, list, given, one, early, leaders, developing, Marcellus, The, company, first, mover, advantage, enabled, lock, 625, 000, net, acres, play, position, concentrated, supersaturated, southwestern, Pennsylvania, region, According, Range, gas, place, analysis, 300, billion, cubic, feet, gas, per, mile, locked, beneath, region, state, twice, amount, gas, per, mile, portions, play, Range, dominant, position, core, gives, resources, needs, defend, spot, top, 
EQT, NYSE, EQT, likewise, holds, concentrated, acreage, position, core, consisting, 660, 000, net, acres, It, position, EQT, used, fuel, compound, annual, production, growth, rate, 31, since, started, developing, Marcellus, 2009, Despite, rapid, rise, EQT, still, plenty, room, growth, The, company, estimates, 31, trillion, cubic, feet, resource, potential, underlie, position, For, perspective, enough, gas, meet, energy, needs, Pennsylvania, three, decades, 
While, Rice, Energy, NYSE, RICE, relatively, small, acreage, position, Marcellus, 94, 000, net, acres, right, within, core, play, Not, company, boasts, lowest, drilling, costs, per, lateral, foot, With, edge, costs, assets, prime, location, Rice, Energy, drill, economic, wells, current, prices, That, able, invest, capital, needed, drive, 53, production, growth, combined, Marcellus, Utica, position, last, year, 
Big, oil, giant, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, holds, dominant, acreage, position, play, 718, 000, net, acres, Unfortunately, Chevron, extraction, costs, quite, low, rivals, forced, scale, back, drilling, Marcellus, prices, weakened, However, company, working, get, costs, financial, capacity, ramp, activities, quickly, prices, recover, 
CONSOL, Energy, NYSE, CNX, also, halted, growth, related, drilling, Marcellus, light, weak, prices, Instead, focusing, completing, recently, drilled, wells, drive, production, growth, year, That, said, like, Chevron, CONSOL, Energy, leading, acreage, position, Marcellus, use, restart, production, growth, pricing, improves, 
Natural, gas, saturates, Marcellus, shale, especially, southwestern, Pennsylvania, Because, producers, staked, prime, positions, region, currently, dominating, larger, play, While, backed, drilling, light, recently, weak, prices, leading, positions, mean, quickly, unleash, torrent, new, supply, natural, gas, prices, improve,
