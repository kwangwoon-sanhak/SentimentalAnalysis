Dividends, great, way, investors, generate, cash, flow, even, beat, market, long, term, But, dividends, guaranteed, payment, company, still, require, cash, flow, operations, maintained, For, reason, higher, risk, lot, investors, think, 
Below, three, companies, I, think, hard, time, maintaining, dividends, 2016, 
Noble, plc, 
One, last, remaining, offshore, drilling, companies, paying, dividend, Noble, OTC, NEBLQ, 
I, think, ends, 2016, The, company, reduced, payout, third, quarter, 0, 375, per, share, 0, 15, per, share, even, may, much, today, environment, 
Earnings, continuing, operations, excluding, one, time, gains, 0, 72, per, share, third, quarter, figure, likely, decline, 2016, Backlog, dropped, 8, 7, billion, second, quarter, 8, 1, billion, third, quarter, new, contracts, dried, Also, 35, per, barrel, oil, cause, offshore, drilling, slump, extended, 2016, 
It, Noble, pay, dividend, 2016, money, could, better, used, elsewhere, Long, term, debt, stood, 4, 5, billion, end, third, quarter, less, leverage, balance, sheet, would, welcome, new, drilling, contracts, hard, find, Most, major, competitors, already, slashed, dividends, 0, shock, investors, get, lower, dividend, 
TerraForm, Power, 
When, dividend, yields, rise, double, digits, sign, investors, really, expect, payout, last, long, That, case, TerraForm, Power, NASDAQ, TERP, 
heading, 2016, As, I, writing, stock, yields, whopping, 11, 1, high, create, problems, company, long, term, 
Yieldcos, like, TerraForm, Power, rely, low, dividend, yields, fund, acquisitions, new, projects, maintain, grow, dividend, The, plan, sell, new, shares, debt, buy, new, projects, generate, higher, return, cost, new, capital, That, happen, dividend, yield, double, digits, 
In, 2016, I, think, TerraForm, Power, would, better, reducing, dividend, either, fund, asset, acquisitions, reduce, debt, load, stood, 2, 5, billion, end, third, quarter, A, lower, payout, would, prudent, move, reduce, risk, year, 
Chevron, 
It, may, seem, outlandish, surface, I, think, 2016, prove, tough, year, big, oil, stocks, They, held, fairly, well, lower, oil, prices, diverse, businesses, 35, per, barrel, oil, gasoline, 2, per, gallon, leave, lot, left, profit, One, could, big, trouble, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
already, paying, dividends, afford, 
The, problem, easy, see, chart, Earnings, plunging, almost, paid, share, form, dividend, 
CVX, NORMALIZED, DILUTED, EPS, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
In, 2016, analysts, expecting, earnings, fall, 3, 42, per, share, meaning, coverage, ratio, earnings, dividend, would, 80, 
Worse, yet, even, slashing, capital, spending, plan, 25, billion, 28, billion, 35, billion, last, year, The, company, still, expecting, spend, drilling, oil, paying, dividends, generates, cash, operations, That, means, way, pay, dividend, add, debt, good, sign, debt, increased, 27, 8, billion, 35, 9, billion, past, nine, months, 
Chevron, best, move, 2016, slashing, dividend, keep, cash, inflows, line, outflows, Whether, may, another, story, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Chevron, Corporation, one,
