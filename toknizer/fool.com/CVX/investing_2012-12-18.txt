In, spirit, Christmas, giving, I, plan, use, next, two, weeks, leading, Christmas, count, 12, Days, Christmas, Foolish, glory, In, rendition, Christmas, tale, hearing, turtle, doves, French, hens, hear, great, ways, save, money, 2013, CEOs, laid, rotten, eggs, 2012, 
In, previous, Foolish, Days, Christmas, looked, 
As, always, I, ask, sing, along, On, sixth, day, Christmas, true, love, gave, 
Six, different, ways, play, energy, sector, 2013, 
U, S, energy, independence, hot, topic, Washington, discovering, produce, energy, many, sources, possible, one, way, U, S, reach, goal, greater, complete, independence, Here, six, considerations, ponder, head, 2013, 
Oil, 
No, matter, evil, oil, might, seem, still, remain, primary, source, fuel, cars, least, decades, According, ExxonMobil, U, S, become, net, exporter, oil, natural, gas, 2025, due, major, finds, Gulf, Mexico, Alaska, throughout, much, central, United, States, 
Without, question, immeasurable, number, ways, play, oil, sector, I, think, company, I, rather, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
gives, investors, exposure, upstream, oil, gas, exploration, production, side, business, also, upstream, refined, product, Just, year, Chevron, moved, dividend, aristocrat, territory, 25th, straight, year, annual, dividend, increases, continues, expand, influence, globally, I, honestly, think, viable, reason, Chevron, 
Coal, 
Coal, accounted, 42, U, S, energy, generation, 2011, even, greater, emphasis, alternative, energies, like, solar, wind, hydroelectric, almost, certain, play, important, role, U, S, energy, picture, During, presidential, debates, even, President, Obama, pledged, continue, emphasize, use, clean, coal, 
Within, U, S, coal, picture, abysmal, Patriot, Coal, going, bankrupt, many, others, seemingly, count, While, I, emphasized, strong, probability, rebound, coal, producers, like, Arch, Coal, NYSE, ACI, de, emphasized, domestic, sales, favor, international, expansion, I, feel, master, limited, partnership, Alliance, Resource, Partners, NASDAQ, ARLP, 
smartest, way, play, coal, 2013, Alliance, Resource, reported, 11, straight, years, record, profits, boosted, dividend, 17, consecutive, quarters, contracted, roughly, 27, million, tons, coal, 2018, plus, minus, 10, virtually, none, exposed, highly, volatile, market, prices, 
Natural, gas, 
Natural, gas, clean, readily, available, thanks, huge, shale, field, finds, throughout, U, S, beginning, rebound, price, In, 2010, natural, gas, accounted, quarter, electricity, generation, given, still, inexpensive, price, clean, burning, qualities, expect, value, climb, higher, 
My, original, thought, suggest, investors, focus, individual, drillers, real, investment, opportunity, natural, gas, lies, storage, transportation, bountiful, energy, resource, Therefore, midstream, master, limited, partnerships, like, TC, Pipelines, NYSE, TCP, 
ONEOK, Partners, NYSE, OKS, 
specialize, activities, pay, handsome, dividends, look, like, could, reap, shareholders, big, rewards, 2013, 
Nuclear, 
Nuclear, energy, still, accounts, approximately, 20, electrical, generation, U, S, unlikely, go, away, anytime, soon, Although, serious, accidents, including, Three, Mile, Island, U, S, Chernobyl, Russia, Fukushima, Daichi, earthquake, related, incident, Japan, tarnished, nuclear, reputation, still, safe, clean, form, energy, generation, 
However, high, costs, producing, nuclear, power, currently, working, industry, Exelon, NASDAQ, EXC, 
U, S, leader, nuclear, production, suffered, miserable, year, rising, nuclear, costs, made, difficult, compete, cheaper, coal, natural, gas, There, however, reasonable, probability, U, S, government, may, consider, kind, subsidy, future, help, nuclear, energy, producers, If, subsidy, pushed, Congress, nuclear, sector, Exelon, could, dirt, cheap, investments, current, levels, 
Solar, 
The, solar, sector, far, completing, washout, inventory, glut, American, Chinese, manufacturers, What, witnessed, washout, many, Chinese, based, solar, firms, took, far, much, debt, managed, inventory, poorly, well, funded, companies, like, SunPower, NASDAQ, SPWR, 
look, poised, prosper, 
Austerity, measures, Europe, may, constrain, orders, first, half, 2013, SunPower, backing, energy, giant, Total, means, little, worry, financial, perspective, It, also, worth, noting, SunPower, one, solar, companies, 100, vertically, integrated, This, means, SunPower, internalize, costs, lower, cost, per, watt, attractive, levels, build, U, S, leading, operating, efficiency, Solar, clearly, big, part, America, energy, independence, plan, SunPower, looks, poised, play, big, role, 
Wind, 
I, admit, I, huge, fan, alternative, energy, investments, I, favor, wind, available, choices, erect, productive, wind, farm, anywhere, zero, emission, energy, source, 
Two, companies, making, big, strides, wind, production, Duke, Energy, NYSE, DUK, 
invested, 2, 5, billion, past, five, years, produce, 1, 000, MW, wind, generated, power, NextEra, Energy, NYSE, NEE, 
largest, wind, power, generating, capacity, U, S, 8, 569, MW, 2011, Ultimately, wind, power, help, drive, customer, costs, big, boost, utilities, bottom, lines, well, big, plus, environment, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Chevron, Corporation, one,
