In, volatile, market, things, change, incredibly, quickly, 
Take, example, second, quarter, earnings, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Just, three, months, ago, oil, gas, supermajor, stunned, Wall, Street, reporting, 3, 6, billion, profit, giant, peers, ExxonMobil, Royal, Dutch, Shell, BP, reported, net, losses, This, time, around, Chevron, reported, massive, 8, 3, billion, net, loss,

LIQUIDS, PRODUCTION, PRIMARILY, CONSISTS, OF, CRUDE, OIL, BUT, ALSO, INCLUDES, BITUMEN, AND, NATURAL, GAS, LIQUIDS, MEASURED, IN, BARRELS, OF, OIL, EQUIVALENT, PER, DAY, BOE, D, DATA, SOURCE, CHEVRON, CHART, BY, AUTHOR, YOY, YEAR, OVER, YEAR, 
That, net, loss, bad, actually, one, better, performances, among, oil, supermajors, BP, posted, 16, 9, billion, net, loss, quarter, Shell, net, loss, 18, 1, billion, Only, ExxonMobil, net, loss, smaller, 1, 1, billion, 
Chevron, debt, load, may, seem, increased, much, past, year, bit, misleading, The, company, paid, 3, billion, debt, late, 2019, ending, year, 27, billion, debt, balance, sheet, In, first, half, 2020, number, ballooned, 26, 34, 1, billion, 
Second, quarter, challenging, one, company, said, CFO, Pierre, Breber, earnings, call, That, putting, mildly, The, 8, 3, billion, loss, Chevron, largest, since, merged, Texaco, 2001, 
Most, investors, already, know, story, First, near, beginning, year, concerns, oversupply, crude, began, pushing, oil, prices, downward, Then, oil, price, war, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, broke, early, March, sending, oil, prices, tumbling, That, dovetailed, drop, demand, COVID, 19, pandemic, accelerated, Oil, prices, remained, low, second, quarter, new, OPEC, agreement, among, producers, curtail, crude, output, signed, Fuel, demand, still, weak, though, due, ongoing, effects, pandemic, Chevron, 20, capital, spending, cut, enough, offset, lack, demand, 
The, major, news, quarter, Chevron, agreement, buy, oil, gas, producer, Noble, Energy, 13, billion, 5, billion, stock, assumption, Noble, 8, billion, debt, The, move, gives, Chevron, Permian, Basin, exposure, seeking, tried, acquire, Anadarko, Petroleum, 2019, It, lost, bidding, war, Anadarko, Occidental, Petroleum, paid, 55, billion, cash, debt, Chevron, walked, away, 1, billion, breakup, fee, gets, Noble, Permian, acreage, 40, size, Anadarko, less, one, quarter, price, including, debt, Occidental, paid, 
The, past, months, presented, unique, challenges, said, Chevron, CEO, Michael, K, Wirth, press, release, echoing, Breber, take, We, focused, control, continued, Our, actions, guided, values, long, standing, financial, priorities, protect, dividend, invest, long, term, value, maintain, strong, balance, sheet, 
Chevron, certainly, seems, best, balance, priorities, By, using, stock, acquire, Noble, preserved, cash, dividend, However, company, avoid, taking, debt, meet, obligations, Luckily, paid, debt, 2019, net, impact, balance, sheet, minimal, 
On, earnings, call, Breber, called, sustaining, growing, dividend, company, first, priority, He, also, pointed, Chevron, comparatively, well, I, guess, I, would, first, step, back, say, different, place, almost, everyone, else, industry, We, one, strongest, balance, sheets, 
Breber, wrong, Chevron, debt, EBITDA, ratio, much, lower, peers, 
CHEVRON, DEBT, TO, EBITDA, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, TTM, TRAILING, 12, MONTHS, 
Ultimately, little, Chevron, oil, company, stop, bleeding, right, Just, like, oil, price, downturn, 2014, 2017, company, wait, hope, crude, oil, prices, demand, recover, quickly, This, time, around, though, Chevron, natural, gas, refined, product, sales, also, fallen, Moreover, trading, business, That, leaves, without, easy, ways, offset, upstream, troubles, 
That, said, Chevron, opportunistic, purchase, Noble, Energy, cheap, using, stock, instead, cash, strategically, smart, The, company, balance, sheet, stronger, supermajor, peers, While, much, uncertainty, oil, industry, right, call, Chevron, buy, seems, better, poor, Q2, results, would, suggest, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear,
