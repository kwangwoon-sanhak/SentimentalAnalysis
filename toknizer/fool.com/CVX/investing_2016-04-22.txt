At, moment, however, Chevron, tough, situation, terms, free, cash, flow, given, low, crude, prices, needed, investment, finish, Gorgon, Wheatstone, projects, become, productive, Given, Chevron, geothermal, operations, grown, much, since, 1990s, company, could, fetch, potential, valuation, 10, times, adjusted, EBITDA, roughly, line, Ormat, Technologies, valuation, assets, management, concluded, much, upside, geothermal, assets, Asia, capital, garnered, could, better, used, elsewhere, 
Although, put, bulk, geothermal, assets, sale, Chevron, could, still, play, leading, role, geothermal, energy, sector, By, one, leading, operators, geothermal, long, Chevron, skills, build, plants, future, locations, Analysts, estimate, potential, geothermal, energy, 10, times, current, global, installed, capacity, 13, GW, meaning, geothermal, substantial, growth, prospects,
