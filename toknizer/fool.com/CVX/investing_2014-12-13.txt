MORNING, HAZE, IN, TIANJIN, CHINA, SOURCE, SHUBERT, CIENCIA, FLICKR, 
China, GDP, grown, 670, 1, 2, trillion, beginning, century, 9, 24, trillion, 2013, That, mind, numbingly, fast, growth, Perhaps, thing, amazing, country, accomplished, feat, help, coal, lot, coal, Some, estimates, demonstrate, China, build, least, one, new, coal, power, per, week, fuel, growth, backed, fact, nearly, 80, electricity, generated, comes, coal, compared, 39, United, States, 
However, recently, agreeing, peak, carbon, dioxide, emissions, 2030, sooner, economists, quickly, realized, China, would, need, reach, peak, coal, usage, well, No, surprise, Beijing, announced, last, month, coal, use, would, peak, 2020, In, fact, provinces, required, cut, production, 99, end, decade, reach, combination, new, pollution, renewable, energy, standards, Although, necessary, reach, carbon, dioxide, emissions, targets, turning, away, coal, creates, uncertainties, power, generation, China, 2020, 
After, accounting, coal, hydropower, projects, energy, sources, account, 12, installed, electricity, capacity, combined, In, words, growth, needed, renewables, natural, gas, nuclear, could, create, big, opportunities, investors, exploit, Here, consider, China, virtually, untapped, shale, gas, reserves, find, overnight, growth, needed, fill, void, left, peaking, coal, whether, Chinese, companies, PetroChina, Company, NYSE, PTR, 
established, multinationals, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
Royal, Dutch, Shell, represent, wiser, potential, investment, 
Shale, gas, revolution, part, 2, 
Energy, investors, well, aware, American, energy, boom, ignited, accessing, shale, oil, gas, China, United, States, actually, largest, recoverable, shale, gas, reserves, world, Progress, slow, nearly, nation, production, currently, comes, conventional, sources, Beijing, big, ambitions, shale, reserves, needed, match, growing, consumption, 
Early, production, shale, basins, proven, difficult, frustrated, likes, Royal, Dutch, Shell, Chevron, several, reasons, First, tricky, geology, China, reserves, deeper, found, United, States, require, new, fracturing, fluid, formulations, break, unique, rock, compositions, Additionally, large, sections, shale, fields, mountainous, terrain, prone, seismic, activity, The, latter, fragmented, recoverable, reserves, reduce, effectiveness, current, horizontal, drilling, techniques, 
Second, supporting, infrastructure, vast, pipeline, networks, still, developed, China, Even, companies, could, produce, large, volumes, gas, would, hard, pressed, move, around, efficiently, 
Third, China, begun, investing, recovering, shale, gas, last, years, Early, projects, exploration, taught, domestic, industry, 1, much, investment, required, 2, likely, need, America, help, 
Is, home, grown, technology, enough, 
The, Chinese, government, keen, cultivate, joint, ventures, largest, energy, firms, For, instance, one, recently, announced, PetroChina, Company, chemical, manufacturer, Sinochem, state, owned, development, company, The, partners, invested, 4, billion, develop, wells, across, 6, 000, square, miles, Chongqing, nation, productive, shale, field, far, begin, production, 2017, The, field, believed, hold, nearly, 8, nation, total, reserves, 
Of, course, 4, billion, investment, swamped, future, investments, required, develop, productive, fields, lay, pipelines, build, processing, facilities, That, reality, kept, initial, nationwide, production, goals, low, China, expects, grow, annual, shale, gas, production, 1, 059, billion, cubic, feet, 30, billion, cubic, meters, 2020, That, pales, comparison, 3, 800, billion, cubic, feet, currently, produced, sources, By, comparison, United, States, produced, 11, 415, billion, cubic, feet, 323, billion, cubic, meters, shale, gas, 2013, 
ONLY, 3, OF, CHINA, S, INSTALLED, CAPACITY, IS, DERIVED, FROM, NATURAL, GAS, COMPARED, TO, 66, FROM, COAL, SOURCE, EIA, 
In, words, long, long, way, go, China, reaches, potential, natural, gas, certainly, occur, 2020, If, really, wants, expedite, arrival, global, leader, shale, technology, may, need, seek, help, multinational, drillers, experience, Bakken, Marcellus, Eagle, Ford, fields, 
Outside, investments, needed, 
It, surprising, China, attempting, develop, technologies, companies, tap, domestic, shale, gas, reserves, And, kept, established, players, either, although, outside, investments, resulted, disappointing, results, date, For, instance, Chevron, owns, 49, 6, 4, billion, project, sport, annual, capacity, 424, billion, cubic, feet, 12, billion, cubic, meters, The, project, delayed, five, years, thanks, challenging, geography, expected, come, online, 2015, earliest, 
Royal, Dutch, Shell, saw, similarly, challenging, geography, slash, expectations, project, China, National, Petroleum, Company, first, sharing, contract, signed, China, major, investment, afterthought, The, company, blamed, geography, dense, population, dampened, goals, essentially, demonstrated, company, better, investment, opportunities, available, 
What, mean, investors, 
While, outside, investments, difficulty, early, demand, cheap, relatively, clean, energy, large, volumes, shale, gas, enticing, China, develop, necessary, technologies, In, current, environment, however, simply, shortage, competitive, global, energy, investments, made, allows, Chevron, Royal, Dutch, Shell, pass, challenging, Chinese, production, Expect, come, knocking, better, technologies, developed, expect, Chinese, shale, gas, represent, major, investing, opportunity, anytime, soon, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Chevron, Corporation, one,
