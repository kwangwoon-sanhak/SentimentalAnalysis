For, past, years, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, management, one, goal, Be, able, pay, dividend, cash, 2017, Just, every, decision, management, made, time, centered, around, goal, even, detriment, future, investments, Well, thanks, serious, changes, portfolio, cuts, operational, expenses, company, able, meet, goal, skin, teeth, 
With, 2018, well, way, I, think, fair, assume, would, get, new, strategic, plan, Chevron, would, align, company, strategic, plans, Big, Oil, companies, significant, production, increases, much, lower, breakeven, costs, Based, recent, analyst, meeting, presentations, though, seem, case, Let, take, look, Chevron, store, next, several, years, plan, seems, lack, oompf, potential, growth, avenues, may, read, lines, 
Glancing, recent, strategic, plans, across, Big, Oil, firms, one, common, theme, All, plan, growing, production, rather, high, rates, next, years, BP, Royal, Dutch, Shell, ExxonMobil, intend, add, 1, million, barrels, per, day, BPD, existing, product, portfolios, At, time, companies, also, making, significant, investments, downstream, operations, contribute, heaps, consistent, cash, flows, offset, ups, downs, upstream, commodity, prices, 
Most, companies, less, move, tandem, Chevron, strategic, plans, seem, differ, significantly, rest, peers, According, management, intends, maintain, low, levels, capital, spending, 18, billion, 20, billion, annually, 2018, 2020, It, appears, larger, focus, Chevron, remains, lowering, costs, continuing, squeeze, assets, currently, producing, It, estimates, grow, production, 4, 7, annually, 2017, numbers, 2020, would, equate, additional, 250, 000, 500, 000, BPD, new, production, 
In, short, run, focusing, costs, existing, assets, great, way, juice, returns, There, trade, though, When, increase, production, levels, already, producing, reservoir, increase, depletion, rate, reservoirs, production, life, reservoir, That, means, road, production, rates, decline, quickly, need, invest, heavily, replace, production, 
At, time, Chevron, investments, downstream, refining, petrochemical, manufacturing, seem, quite, modest, compared, rest, Part, reason, much, Chevron, petrochemical, capacity, held, joint, venture, Phillips, 66, known, CP, Chem, capital, spending, venture, come, directly, Chevron, cash, capital, investments, Still, Chevron, track, record, selling, downstream, assets, lately, intends, shed, even, near, future, South, Africa, refinery, currently, held, sale, There, appear, significant, growth, trajectory, part, business, especially, compared, peers, 
If, investors, little, discouraged, plan, may, solace, one, part, business, Chevron, remains, rather, quiet, shale, Sure, company, proudly, touting, progress, Permian, Basin, Permian, production, exceeded, every, company, estimate, thus, far, However, Permian, assets, one, portion, rather, extensive, position, various, shale, basins, across, North, America, 
The, thing, stands, anything, else, resource, estimate, At, 17, 5, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, massive, resource, base, could, fuel, Chevron, production, decade, As, stands, today, shale, resources, represent, one, quarter, company, total, resource, backlog, Also, Chevron, shown, Permian, holdings, deliver, shale, production, relatively, economically, 
Probably, reason, Chevron, shouting, rooftop, assets, incredibly, challenging, monetize, point, All, regions, constrained, comes, infrastructure, Canadian, shale, gas, formations, like, Duvernay, need, another, market, sell, U, S, well, shale, gas, already, cheap, 
Chevron, Duvernay, less, mentioned, Horn, River, shale, gas, holdings, resource, base, underpins, Chevron, plans, massive, Kitimat, LNG, facility, project, management, previously, touted, strangely, quiet, past, years, These, two, assets, likely, get, developed, concurrently, probably, happen, two, three, year, window, current, strategic, plan, covers, 
For, investor, looking, Chevron, strategic, plan, next, years, whole, lot, get, excited, Management, playing, safe, plan, remains, focused, cutting, costs, bolstering, balance, sheet, keeping, conservative, capital, plan, That, necessarily, bad, thing, stand, contrast, peers, appear, able, achieve, first, two, things, ramping, spending, Personally, discouraging, aspect, plan, lack, downstream, investment, Chevron, business, already, highest, exposure, production, seems, doubling, position, instead, rounding, integrated, business, model, 
Still, longer, tail, parts, business, buy, hold, investors, excited, Chevron, shale, business, could, easily, become, one, biggest, profit, engines, 2020s, able, develop, infrastructure, necessary, monetize, assets, 
For, investors, likely, better, looking, peers, It, going, take, Chevron, put, plan, together, deliver, shale, assets, plans, place, others, look, like, deliver, superior, returns, 
Before, consider, Chevron, Corporation, want, hear,
