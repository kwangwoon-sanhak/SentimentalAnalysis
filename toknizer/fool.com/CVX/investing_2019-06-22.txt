Oil, behemoth, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, refining, giant, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, working, together, petrochemicals, industry, nearly, two, decades, 50, 50, joint, venture, CPChem, They, built, one, world, largest, petrochemical, manufacturing, companies, operates, 31, production, facilities, five, countries, 
They, mainly, grown, business, organically, building, new, petrochemical, complexes, including, recently, investing, 6, billion, expand, capacity, U, S, Gulf, Coast, However, according, report, Reuters, made, offer, buy, Canadian, plastics, maker, Nova, Chemicals, 15, billion, That, deal, would, increase, joint, venture, scale, expand, footprint, making, meaningful, growth, driver, two, energy, giants, 
Nova, Chemicals, manufactures, polyethylene, resins, common, plastic, expandable, styrenics, foam, resins, used, make, things, like, cups, containers, several, facilities, U, S, Canada, The, company, currently, owned, Abu, Dhabi, sovereign, wealth, fund, bought, mere, 500, million, global, financial, crisis, 2009, The, fund, gave, financial, resources, needed, grow, That, allowed, company, rapidly, expand, past, decade, took, advantage, North, America, abundance, low, cost, oil, natural, gas, key, raw, materials, used, make, plastics, 
An, acquisition, Nova, Chemicals, CPChem, would, expand, footprint, Canada, also, increasing, presence, key, U, S, Gulf, Coast, petrochemicals, hub, Nova, Chemicals, currently, operates, several, facilities, along, Gulf, Coast, recently, signed, joint, venture, two, petrochemical, companies, build, new, facilities, Texas, That, enable, company, take, even, greater, advantage, cheap, oil, gas, flowing, region, 
Nova, U, S, Gulf, Coast, growth, strategy, lines, CPChem, plan, The, company, recently, started, three, new, petrochemical, plants, region, part, 6, billion, expansion, program, Meanwhile, Chevron, Phillips, 66, currently, considering, building, another, new, petrochemical, plant, area, would, cost, 5, billion, 6, billion, 
Chevron, makes, money, producing, oil, Phillips, 66, primarily, oil, refiner, In, first, quarter, 2019, example, Chevron, upstream, business, contributed, 3, 1, billion, earnings, downstream, operations, include, refining, business, well, stake, CPChem, hauled, 252, million, profit, The, chemicals, segment, meanwhile, larger, contributor, Phillips, 66, period, supplying, 227, million, 319, million, adjusted, earnings, though, solely, due, challenges, facing, refining, sector, quarter, Because, minor, contributor, investors, pay, much, attention, chemicals, joint, venture, 
However, CPChem, steady, contributor, companies, years, It, helps, offset, volatility, primary, operations, since, earnings, upstream, oil, production, refining, swing, wildly, due, fluctuations, prices, oil, gas, Because, chemicals, business, consumes, oil, gas, acts, natural, hedge, swings, commodity, prices, 
Another, benefit, petrochemicals, business, enables, energy, companies, maximize, per, barrel, profit, Chevron, example, take, oil, gas, pumps, places, like, Permian, Basin, eventually, turn, production, higher, value, chemicals, Phillips, 66, likewise, take, naphtha, produces, oil, refineries, well, propane, ethane, makes, natural, gas, liquids, processing, complexes, turn, building, blocks, plastics, 
The, final, benefit, CPChem, brings, two, energy, giants, growth, prospects, As, mentioned, company, taking, advantage, increase, oil, gas, production, North, America, build, new, petrochemical, complexes, along, U, S, Gulf, Coast, increase, production, profitability, Meanwhile, acquire, Nova, company, would, increase, ability, expand, since, also, grow, Canada, gas, rich, Marcellus, Utica, shale, regions, Northeast, Nova, operates, several, facilities, 
CPChem, interest, buying, Nova, Chemicals, surprising, since, would, fit, well, strategy, expand, North, America, The, proposed, acquisition, would, significantly, expand, scale, improving, growth, prospects, since, Nova, partners, currently, building, new, capacity, Texas, However, even, CPChem, make, deal, significantly, impact, Chevron, Phillips, 66, smaller, contributor, earnings, already, needle, moving, expansion, works,
