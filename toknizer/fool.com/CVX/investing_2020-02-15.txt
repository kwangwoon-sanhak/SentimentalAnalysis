Everyone, seems, hate, oil, companies, today, one, reason, many, offer, dividends, big, fat, yields, The, problem, real, reasons, worried, energy, stocks, bankruptcies, picking, particularly, onshore, U, S, oil, space, But, oil, companies, created, equal, Some, better, built, weather, ups, downs, highly, cyclical, industry, 
Here, three, high, yield, oil, stocks, proven, takes, survive, keep, paying, generous, dividends, intrepid, investors, willing, buy, hold, others, grow, skittish, 
ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, probably, one, hated, integrated, oil, natural, gas, giants, world, massive, size, Though, ESG, investors, pushed, hard, convince, energy, company, management, change, course, decided, double, oil, drilling, They, unapologetic, plans, spend, much, 35, billion, year, capital, projects, like, expanding, onshore, U, S, oil, production, drilling, waters, around, Guyana,

In, fact, next, years, Exxon, likely, see, production, head, higher, years, contraction, Not, capital, spending, however, directed, toward, drilling, The, company, also, investing, downstream, operations, boosting, refining, petrochemical, manufacturing, capabilities, That, notable, like, next, two, companies, discussed, Exxon, diversified, across, energy, sector, That, gives, portfolio, balance, though, right, even, downstream, operations, performing, well, tough, environment, 
The, thing, Exxon, built, like, tank, handle, heavy, spending, weak, business, environment, For, example, debt, equity, ratio, around, 0, 15, puts, low, end, peer, group, frankly, low, range, company, industry, Now, add, dividend, increased, annually, 37, consecutive, years, currently, yields, 5, 8, toward, high, end, historical, range, see, contrarian, investors, investigating, stock, today, 
Perhaps, Exxon, decision, double, oil, drilling, little, much, In, case, might, want, look, peer, U, S, energy, giant, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, It, one, largest, diversified, energy, companies, Earth, But, unlike, Exxon, decided, conservative, capital, spending, plans, earmarking, 20, billion, toward, Relative, cash, flow, operations, lowest, level, peer, group, 
That, said, Chevron, benefiting, previous, spending, production, still, growing, right, Thus, hardly, giving, oil, falling, behind, peers, like, Exxon, major, effort, underway, onshore, U, S, oil, space, The, big, difference, Chevron, way, invest, energy, sector, without, accepting, risks, inherent, big, investments, Exxon, making, 
XOM, FINANCIAL, DEBT, TO, EQUITY, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Chevron, meanwhile, also, extremely, attractive, look, dividend, history, dividend, yield, balance, sheet, The, company, increased, payout, annually, 32, years, The, yield, currently, robust, 4, 7, And, like, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, sits, near, low, end, industry, roughly, 0, 15, Chevron, balance, sheet, built, like, rock, company, take, current, oil, downturn, stride, 
France, Total, S, A, NYSE, TOT, bit, different, Exxon, Chevron, For, starters, debt, equity, ratio, around, 0, 45, manageable, amount, leverage, energy, giant, In, fact, company, long, operated, debt, U, S, counterparts, Meanwhile, increased, dividend, quite, regularly, payout, generally, trended, higher, recent, years, Note, Total, foreign, company, dividend, U, S, investors, receive, fluctuate, along, relative, valuations, euro, dollar, That, said, roughly, 5, 9, yield, highest, trio, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
But, really, big, difference, Total, starting, invest, outside, oil, natural, gas, space, In, fact, 2018, paid, roughly, 1, 8, billion, buy, European, electric, utility, That, one, many, efforts, Total, making, diversify, away, carbon, based, energy, business, It, also, putting, money, work, renewable, power, generation, solar, wind, space, investing, electric, vehicle, charging, operations, among, things, 
To, fair, Total, still, primarily, oil, gas, company, It, planning, drastic, overnight, changes, It, using, core, operations, foundation, position, clean, energy, future, If, sounds, like, better, path, Exxon, Chevron, taking, well, served, take, close, look, Total, right, 
Oil, industry, executives, clear, future, oil, going, away, energy, source, anytime, soon, still, high, demand, Put, simply, oil, continues, play, integral, role, world, The, current, price, weakness, par, course, commodity, known, volatility, Exxon, Chevron, Total, built, deal, ups, downs, continuing, pay, investors, well, stick, around, 
Each, global, giants, however, taking, slightly, different, approach, So, like, buy, others, selling, good, time, look, trio, You, need, select, one, whose, strategy, best, reflects, long, term, view, world, energy, future,
