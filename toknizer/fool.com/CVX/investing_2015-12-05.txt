According, David, Pursell, head, macro, research, TPH, By, sanctioning, projects, today, putting, hole, production, 2017, 2018, 2019, potentially, big, hole, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, example, could, delay, 25, projects, representing, roughly, 2, 5, million, barrels, day, capacity, In, fact, Exxon, already, significantly, scaled, back, spending, recent, years, spending, expected, average, around, 34, billion, next, several, years, well, peak, 42, 5, billion, 2013, What, important, note, lag, elevated, spending, level, expected, production, ramp, going, 4, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, last, year, 4, 3, million, BOE, 2017, It, number, could, flatline, even, fall, future, ExxonMobil, really, pulls, back, reins, spending, delaying, projects,

The, big, factor, project, delays, economics, many, projects, simply, making, economic, sense, current, prices, In, fact, new, oil, sands, project, breakeven, point, upwards, 95, 114, per, barrel, Because, cost, international, oil, giants, Statoil, NYSE, STO, Total, NYSE, TOT, postponed, projects, economics, make, sense, Statoil, example, decided, put, three, year, pause, development, 40, 000, barrel, per, day, Corner, project, oil, prices, started, slide, September, 2014, rising, costs, limited, pipeline, capacity, put, project, economics, risk, Meanwhile, even, crude, took, dive, Total, suspended, work, nearly, 10, billion, Joslyn, oil, sands, mine, due, troubling, economics, project, 
Deepwater, projects, likewise, costly, often, requiring, 75, oil, price, Chevron, example, delayed, Rosebank, North, Sea, development, November, 2013, Brent, crude, well, 100, per, barrel, saying, currently, offer, economic, value, proposition, justify, estimated, 8, billion, investment, That, prohibitive, price, tag, likely, keep, Rosebank, estimated, 240, million, BOE, underground, quite, years, 
Investor, takeaway, 
Big, oil, producers, significantly, reduced, spending, major, projects, could, leave, big, hole, future, oil, supplies, That, said, pure, economic, decisions, many, projects, still, requiring, triple, digit, oil, prices, justify, investments, So, either, oil, prices, need, rebound, costs, must, come, oil, ever, see, light, day, That, said, concern, much, oil, staying, underground, oil, prices, could, significantly, spike, stay, elevated, would, take, years, projects, would, deliver, drop, oil, The, implication, producers, might, need, bite, bullet, begin, work, project, currently, economically, rational, anticipation, prices, improving, future, given, fact, supplies, naturally, decline, adequate, investments, made, bring, new, supplies, online,
