Since, commodity, prices, swing, much, impact, profitability, company, looking, financial, metrics, like, price, earnings, might, accurate, measurement, A, better, one, consider, price, tangible, book, value, On, surface, Nabors, really, look, overvalued, compared, peers,

As, competitors, greater, financial, flexibility, invest, new, rigs, meet, needs, today, advanced, drilling, operations, Nabors, need, focus, managing, debt, load, If, I, looking, investing, space, today, seems, Nabors, overvalued, compared, peers, despite, numbers, say, 
Jason, Hall, As, beaten, many, oil, gas, companies, right, I, think, great, values, With, said, probably, even, value, traps, It, looking, like, integrated, major, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, 
potentially, overvalued, even, seen, stock, fall, 30, since, July, 2014, 
I, know, thinking, Integrated, majors, supposed, safest, investments, oil, prices, since, benefit, cheap, oil, parts, business, And, true, looking, like, much, smarter, Tyler, Crowe, pointed, Chevron, exposure, oil, production, hurting, much, segments, helping, 
And, oil, prices, exactly, getting, better, 
Don, get, wrong, I, really, concerned, Chevron, long, term, future, It, strong, balance, sheet, 12, billion, cash, hand, But, think, Chevron, generated, 9, 5, billion, cash, operations, far, year, spent, 19, billion, capital, expenditures, dividends, That, significant, trend, management, must, reverse, 
Frankly, could, get, worse, things, get, better, There, essentially, good, news, demand, side, year, global, production, stubborn, slow, We, could, look, back, years, see, great, time, buy, frankly, I, want, see, fundamental, improvements, Chevron, global, oil, markets, investing, company, 
Matt, DiLallo, Like, Jason, I, also, big, oil, giant, I, think, overvalued, However, I, different, reasons, I, think, BP, NYSE, BP, 
looks, overvalued, Some, market, really, unfounded, belief, BP, takeover, target, Making, matters, worse, BP, good, operator, big, oil, brethren, needs, much, higher, oil, prices, generate, cash, flow, needs, run, business, With, neither, horizon, BP, stock, really, looks, unappealing, 
There, rumors, within, industry, ExxonMobil, eyes, BP, potential, merger, partner, This, possibility, inflated, BP, stock, price, bit, though, recent, weakness, oil, prices, deflated, bit, premium, Still, trading, much, much, higher, multiple, either, Exxon, Chevron, 
BP, P, E, RATIO, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
This, premium, completely, unjustified, two, reasons, First, BP, make, great, buyout, candidate, would, buyer, still, faces, unknown, potential, Deepwater, Horizon, liabilities, British, government, already, said, would, opposed, buyout, BP, Second, BP, good, operator, Exxon, Chevron, see, following, chart, returns, well, peers, 
BP, RETURN, ON, EQUITY, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Furthermore, Jason, mentioned, lower, oil, prices, making, tough, big, oil, giants, match, cash, flow, cash, outflows, like, capex, dividends, Analysts, estimate, BP, needs, 75, Brent, crude, oil, price, next, year, balance, budget, likely, given, Brent, currently, well, south, 50, moment, This, suggests, company, adding, lot, debt, selling, assets, wrong, time, slashing, dividend, 
Suffice, say, BP, exactly, value, stock, days, case, made, grossly, overvalued, 40, oil, new, normal,
