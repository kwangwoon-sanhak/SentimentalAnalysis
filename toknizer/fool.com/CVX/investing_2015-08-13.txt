Linn, LinnCo, already, cut, respective, distribution, dividend, I, thought, investors, finally, woods, even, 50, oil, That, Linn, management, repeatedly, stressed, could, cover, payouts, year, underlying, cash, flow, result, aggressive, cost, cutting, hedging, practices, 
Indeed, last, quarter, Linn, lease, operating, expenses, declined, 18, versus, previous, quarter, This, helped, Linn, generate, 71, million, excess, operating, cash, distributions, last, quarter, good, sign, distribution, secure, 
But, old, saying, goes, something, looks, good, true, usually, Linn, double, digit, yield, vanish, The, company, recently, stated, would, continue, distribute, payout, next, two, months, recommend, board, complete, suspension, distribution, end, third, quarter, save, cash, 
It, true, suspension, shore, company, balance, sheet, good, thing, Linn, save, 450, million, per, year, plans, repurchase, 599, million, senior, notes, steep, 35, discount, This, help, company, reduce, massive, long, term, debt, load, stood, 10, 9, billion, end, last, quarter,

The, company, gave, reason, reversal, noting, reducing, rig, count, 11, eight, balance, year, would, result, 6, 5, production, growth, 2015, 7, Instead, reduction, seems, reaction, recent, drop, oil, prices, especially, last, weeks, July, see, chart, 
WTI, CRUDE, OIL, SPOT, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Clearly, Whiting, Petroleum, expect, oil, fall, leaving, choice, react, quickly, cut, capex, While, something, said, flexible, company, really, even, considered, increase, capex, budget, oil, market, firmer, footing, 
Furthermore, opinion, Whiting, really, even, growing, production, oversaturated, market, Instead, keep, production, flat, use, excess, capital, bolster, balance, sheet, ample, capacity, grow, conditions, meaningfully, improve,
