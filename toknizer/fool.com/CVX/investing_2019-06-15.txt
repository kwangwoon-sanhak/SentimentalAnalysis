While, America, demand, oil, related, liquids, reached, new, heights, last, year, consuming, gasoline, Instead, rising, appetite, mainly, due, completion, several, new, petrochemical, plants, turn, liquids, like, NGLs, building, blocks, plastics, With, second, wave, petrochemical, plants, coming, export, capacity, construction, U, S, demand, continue, rising,
