Oil, prices, plunged, last, months, 2018, putting, stress, many, oil, producers, budgets, This, led, widespread, predictions, reduced, capex, idled, oil, rigs, downturn, U, S, oil, production, 2019, 
Sure, enough, number, rigs, drilling, oil, U, S, falling, year, including, declines, past, five, weeks, The, oil, rig, count, still, higher, year, ago, fallen, 60, since, late, 2018, 
U, S, OIL, RIG, COUNT, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
However, widely, followed, oil, rig, count, statistic, really, mean, much, anymore, Even, fewer, rigs, work, least, U, S, oil, production, likely, continue, rising, rapid, clip, 2019, beyond, oil, giants, like, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, ramp, shale, drilling, activities, 
The, fundamental, reason, rig, count, become, misleading, shale, oil, plays, drilling, oil, well, always, lead, immediately, starting, production, At, point, well, drilled, hydraulic, fracturing, also, known, fracking, injection, highly, pressurized, water, sand, starts, flow, oil, Fracking, sometimes, takes, place, right, rig, removed, always, 
There, various, reasons, drilling, immediately, completing, well, For, example, fracking, crews, materials, may, short, supply, Some, oil, leases, require, drilling, within, certain, time, period, require, production, begin, require, token, amount, production, That, means, might, make, sense, keep, drilling, slow, well, completion, activity, oil, prices, fall, Shortages, pipeline, capacity, could, also, affect, well, completion, activity, 
Over, past, five, years, number, drilled, uncompleted, DUC, wells, U, S, soared, At, end, 2013, DUC, well, count, 4, 199, seven, major, regions, tracked, Energy, Information, Administration, EIA, That, figure, reached, 8, 576, end, February, 2019, 
The, Permian, Basin, centered, western, Texas, accounts, vast, majority, increase, The, Permian, DUC, well, count, surged, sixfold, 636, 4, 004, since, end, 2013, whereas, number, DUC, wells, risen, 28, across, six, regions, combined, 
The, number, wells, drilled, Permian, Basin, peaked, 622, last, October, fell, 574, February, However, number, Permian, well, completions, rose, 444, October, 486, last, month, Not, two, figures, move, opposite, directions, even, recent, reduction, drilling, activity, well, completion, crews, still, keeping, pace, number, wells, drilled, Factoring, huge, backlog, DUC, wells, producers, could, ramp, well, completions, 50, without, needing, increase, drilling, activity, least, year, 
PRODUCTION, CHANGES, DON, T, NECESSARILY, TRACK, CHANGES, IN, THE, RIG, COUNT, ANYMORE, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
The, growing, involvement, oil, majors, shale, oil, production, particularly, Permian, Basin, another, reason, read, much, recent, rig, count, declines, 
Traditionally, biggest, players, shale, oil, smaller, independent, energy, companies, In, recent, years, companies, forced, cut, back, drilling, activity, whenever, oil, prices, fall, order, avoid, burning, much, cash, However, complete, already, drilled, wells, keep, production, steady, growing, shore, cash, flow, 
By, contrast, massive, oil, giants, like, Chevron, ExxonMobil, ability, invest, long, term, Also, companies, taken, deliberate, approach, Permian, Basin, lots, testing, learning, pay, form, higher, rig, productivity, future, Productivity, improvements, another, reason, rig, count, misleading, 
Chevron, ExxonMobil, ready, ramp, activity, Permian, Basin, Chevron, plans, double, Permian, production, 900, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, boepd, end, 2023, steady, growth, period, Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, midst, dramatically, increasing, drilling, fracking, activity, It, expects, produce, 1, million, BOE, D, Permian, region, 2024, 200, 000, BOE, D, recently, 
Check, latest, earnings, call, transcripts, Chevron, ExxonMobil, 
Between, huge, number, DUC, wells, Permian, Basin, Chevron, ExxonMobil, plans, increase, drilling, activity, dramatically, recent, rig, count, declines, likely, lead, falling, production, In, fact, growing, pipeline, capacity, Permian, region, likely, encourage, accelerated, production, growth, next, couple, years, 
For, 2018, price, crude, oil, Midland, Texas, heart, Permian, Basin, traded, discount, U, S, benchmark, WTI, In, August, September, discount, reached, high, around, 18, per, barrel, shortage, pipeline, capacity, led, glut, oil, Permian, region, Extra, pipeline, capacity, come, line, since, causing, Midland, crude, trade, slight, premium, WTI, recently, 
As, result, even, though, WTI, prices, still, 10, per, barrel, relative, last, August, September, Permian, producers, making, money, today, Nevertheless, producers, may, still, skittish, dramatically, increasing, well, completions, region, still, delicate, balance, oil, production, pipeline, capacity, 
That, change, soon, numerous, pipelines, construction, could, increase, takeaway, capacity, 4, million, barrels, per, day, next, two, years, A, big, chunk, capacity, come, line, second, half, 2019, 
With, pipeline, constraints, set, ease, later, year, oil, producers, likely, ramp, output, prolific, shale, region, 2019, 2020, regardless, short, term, changes, rig, count, That, likely, keep, lid, oil, prices, foreseeable, future,
