So, get, Well, Chevron, Dow, youngest, dividend, aristocrat, Before, 1988, Chevron, made, number, consecutive, quarterly, dividend, payments, 0, 15, payout, increased, every, year, since, current, quarterly, dividend, 1, 00, It, slow, steady, climb, past, 26, years, 
CVX, DIVIDEND, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Chevron, stable, business, economists, think, demand, key, product, continue, rise, future, chart, Chevron, dividend, increases, payments, look, similar, one, see, So, next, question, investors, well, stock, price, appreciated, past, years, 
Since, late, February, 1988, stock, 896, 9, 2, annualized, without, reinvestment, dividends, Adding, dividends, improves, performance, 2, 455, annualized, return, 13, 3, Over, past, 26, years, S, P, 500, returned, 587, annualized, 7, 69, without, dividends, reinvested, even, reinvest, Chevron, dividends, still, would, outperformed, S, P, period, 
But, Chevron, still, good, buy, going, forward, Let, look, investors, watching, 
Over, next, 30, years, economists, estimate, world, energy, consumption, increase, 56, fossil, fuels, projected, supply, almost, 80, world, energy, 2040, Fossil, fuels, Chevron, bread, butter, meaning, demand, product, keep, rising, But, finite, supply, oil, gas, left, often, hard, access, That, already, started, causing, problems, Chevron, probably, continue, bring, new, challenges, coming, years, 
Rising, costs, exploration, drilling, could, also, weigh, company, margins, profitability, future, costs, go, Chevron, start, charging, oil, since, oil, traded, commodity, meaning, company, set, price, market, 
Investors, also, keep, eye, oversupplies, oil, gas, market, When, began, finding, natural, gas, abundance, U, S, price, commodity, fell, floor, A, number, smaller, businesses, since, pulled, industry, make, profit, It, unlikely, thing, could, happen, Chevron, company, stay, vigilant, 
Finally, Chevron, currently, pays, 35, profits, form, dividend, industry, requires, heavy, investing, large, amount, free, cash, So, Chevron, industry, 35, safe, place, investors, well, served, company, continue, grow, profits, free, cash, flow, Chevron, raise, dividend, without, increasing, payout, ratio, On, hand, even, Chevron, falls, hard, times, could, manage, raise, dividend, payout, ratio, without, causing, substantial, harm, long, management, reinvests, back, business, research, development, projects, 
Final, thoughts, 
Chevron, great, company, going, anywhere, There, long, term, concerns, industry, none, analysis, takes, account, unforeseen, events, like, massive, oil, spill, As, saw, BP, following, Deepwater, Horizon, disaster, events, devastating, company, dividend, These, things, investors, oil, gas, companies, always, need, keep, mind, There, risks, investments, big, risk, comes, big, potential, reward, That, true, Chevron, much, peers,

The, bad, capital, expenditure, 
Exxon, capital, expenditure, rose, 2013, 6, 7, reach, 42, 5, billion, Roughly, 10, amount, 4, 3, billion, allocated, toward, acquisitions, But, 2014, company, likely, maintain, similar, amount, capex, Chevron, capex, sharply, increased, 22, 2013, year, year, reached, 41, 8, billion, Out, amount, 4, billion, allotted, toward, new, acquisitions, Chevron, also, plans, maintain, capital, spending, 40, billion, But, lack, growth, capex, necessarily, mean, companies, grow, slower, could, suggest, fewer, assets, worth, investing, current, oil, prices, Moreover, allow, companies, keep, dividend, payments, reduce, financial, risk, may, face,
