There, many, many, safer, sectors, invest, right, oil, industry, Yes, entire, stock, market, turmoil, due, coronavirus, concerns, companies, sector, dealing, oil, price, collapse, top, sudden, drop, demand, fuel, caused, travel, restrictions, Oil, companies, slashing, dividends, right, left, least, one, Whiting, Petroleum, filed, bankruptcy, 
With, oil, prices, low, independent, exploration, production, companies, E, Ps, going, tough, time, investing, right, recommended, Oilfield, services, companies, rig, operators, also, going, feel, pinch, decreased, demand, numerous, producers, announced, cuts, capital, budgets, So, good, candidates, either, 
If, really, committed, investing, oil, industry, right, best, bet, go, strongest, dividend, paying, companies, better, chance, weathering, storm, intact, rewarding, patience, bargain, That, I, recommending, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, Here, top, picks, sector, April, 
Like, rest, oil, industry, integrated, oil, major, Royal, Dutch, Shell, saw, stock, fall, early, March, oil, price, war, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, resulted, countries, vowing, flood, global, energy, market, cheap, crude, Oil, prices, barely, hovering, 50, barrel, news, essentially, cut, prices, half, dragging, Shell, shares, along, everyone, else, industry, 
There, way, Shell, going, outperform, oil, prices, low, And, unlike, last, oil, price, downturn, 2014, refined, products, like, petrochemicals, gasoline, also, low, thanks, oversupply, So, Shell, able, lean, heavily, downstream, refining, marketing, business, past, 
However, one, thing, Shell, still, going, best, class, dividend, top, yielder, among, oil, majors, last, five, currently, yielding, 10, And, Shell, committed, maintaining, dividend, recently, announcing, cut, 2020, capital, spending, least, 20, suspend, share, buyback, program, help, preserve, cash, maintain, payout, 
Also, working, Shell, favor, rock, solid, balance, sheet, high, credit, rating, shareholder, friendly, management, team, Shell, looks, like, safe, bet, continue, paying, full, dividend, oil, prices, recover, 
For, strongest, companies, oil, industry, keeping, proverbial, lights, wait, recovery, ExxonMobil, company, renowned, strength, balance, sheet, uniquely, positioned, 
Exxon, current, dividend, yield, 8, 4, may, high, Big, Oil, peer, Shell, near, March, record, high, company, Better, yet, ExxonMobil, dividend, aristocrat, upped, payout, every, last, 37, That, streak, company, management, definitely, wants, continue, 
The, company, offered, major, reassurance, market, dividend, secure, rolled, 30, cut, 2020, capital, spending, additional, 15, operational, spending, Like, Shell, plans, use, money, saves, continue, paying, dividend, Also, like, Shell, excellent, credit, rating, case, needs, tap, capital, markets, help, weather, current, storm, 
If, integrated, oil, majors, cup, Texas, tea, might, consider, investment, strong, oil, refiner, like, Phillips, 66, The, company, produce, oil, somewhat, insulated, crude, oil, price, swings, diversified, portfolio, including, Phillips, 66, Conoco, 76, branded, filling, stations, refinery, network, even, exposure, pipelines, master, limited, partnership, MLP, Phillips, 66, Partners, 
Under, ordinary, circumstances, low, crude, prices, would, good, Phillips, 66, could, earn, higher, margins, refining, operations, increase, traffic, filling, stations, due, lower, gas, prices, These, unfortunately, ordinary, circumstances, 
Thanks, global, travel, production, shutdowns, caused, coronavirus, concerns, demand, refined, products, like, fuel, petrochemicals, collapsed, That, made, existing, oversupply, problem, even, worse, refiners, like, Phillips, 66, stuck, waiting, demand, increase, Luckily, Phillips, 66, 1, 6, billion, cash, books, consistent, track, record, cash, generation, help, fund, dividend, currently, yielding, 6, 1, 
Unfortunately, oil, companies, may, make, current, oil, price, slump, Still, others, make, side, severely, slashing, dividends, The, best, companies, though, able, maintain, increase, dividends, still, emerge, relatively, unscathed, thanks, strength, operations, balance, sheets, 
Oil, may, right, place, invest, money, right, decide, buy, Royal, Dutch, Shell, ExxonMobil, Phillips, 66, look, like, best, picks, make, 
Before, consider, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, one, 
Right, stock, market, may, seem, like, investor, nightmare, shares, companies, large, small, double, digit, percentages, far, But, hand, might, actually, look, like, opportunity, value, investors, Plenty, stocks, especially, large, cap, stocks, trading, bargain, prices, 
Unfortunately, lot, stocks, cheap, good, reasons, Coronavirus, related, travel, restrictions, oil, price, war, souring, global, economy, may, make, hard, beaten, companies, recover, 
But, even, market, like, one, savvy, investors, find, good, prospects, Three, large, cap, stocks, looking, like, top, buys, right, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Disney, NYSE, DIS, Here, may, want, consider, grabbing, shares, cheap, 
The, first, large, cap, stock, I, picking, largest, oil, company, world, revenue, integrated, oil, gas, giant, Royal, Dutch, Shell, Its, shares, 37, 2020, fallen, farther, broader, market, thanks, collapsing, oil, prices, 
After, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, failed, come, agreement, production, limits, early, March, countries, vowed, flood, market, cheap, oil, cutting, crude, prices, almost, half, stocks, across, industry, fell, well, Shell, shares, lost, half, value, next, two, weeks, rebounding, bit, management, announced, would, cutting, 2020, expenses, suspending, share, repurchase, program, 
The, market, liked, moves, offered, indication, Shell, cut, best, class, dividend, currently, yielding, 10, While, current, crude, oversupply, good, news, Shell, short, term, company, solid, balance, sheet, sizable, cash, hoard, plenty, experience, weathering, periods, low, oil, prices, It, problem, continuing, payout, oil, prices, stabilize, whenever, happens, 
While, Shell, dividend, yield, may, highest, among, oil, majors, actually, upped, quarterly, payout, per, share, since, 2014, However, fellow, oil, major, ExxonMobil, increased, dividend, every, since, fact, every, since, 1983, 
That, record, makes, ExxonMobil, one, small, number, Dividend, Aristocrats, companies, increased, dividend, payments, annually, least, 25, straight, Maintaining, status, important, company, one, reason, likely, payout, even, though, currently, yielding, almost, 9, record, high, company, 
ExxonMobil, also, going, hurt, short, term, low, oil, prices, oil, superpowers, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, U, S, get, deal, worked, production, limits, soon, shares, along, Shell, oil, companies, likely, volatile, may, fall, even, farther, But, ExxonMobil, size, global, footprint, position, well, weather, short, term, volatility, reward, investors, long, run, 
Speaking, companies, experiencing, short, term, headwinds, Disney, experiencing, short, term, hurricane, Coronavirus, necessitated, travel, restrictions, forced, close, theme, parks, indefinitely, still, expensive, maintain, even, without, guests, Movie, theaters, closed, pushed, new, film, debuts, future, And, powerhouse, ESPN, television, network, much, content, show, since, professional, college, sports, leagues, canceled, seasons,

Large, cap, stocks, tend, add, stability, portfolio, long, COVID, 19, pandemic, keeping, entire, economy, uncertain, ground, even, large, cap, stocks, experience, fair, share, volatility, But, good, thing, investors, looking, buy, shares, discount, And, right, Royal, Dutch, Shell, ExxonMobil, Disney, look, like, bargains, 
Before, consider, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, want, hear,

As, much, rest, stock, market, strange, painful, ride, past, six, weeks, oil, stocks, brutalized, Global, oil, markets, total, disarray, oil, demand, craters, global, travel, halted, Saudi, Arabia, threatens, flood, market, effort, establish, dominance, 
Yet, even, demand, cratering, global, heavyweights, threatening, drown, competitors, still, hope, OPEC, producers, including, Russia, set, meet, week, discuss, potential, output, cuts, help, stabilize, oil, prices, near, term, In, long, term, oil, demand, recover, travel, resumes, businesses, reopen, 
THE, OIL, PATCH, IS, LADEN, WITH, RISK, BUT, THERE, IS, VALUE, FOR, INVESTORS, WILLING, TO, BE, PATIENT, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
The, latter, eventual, recovery, oil, many, investors, hunting, oil, patch, value, right, After, many, oil, producers, struggle, fail, plenty, value, patient, investors, willing, ride, worst, downturn, And, true, challenge, right, discerning, value, trap, waiting, spring, 
The, one, segment, oil, industry, filled, value, traps, independent, producer, space, We, already, seen, one, former, high, flying, independent, producer, fall, grace, Whiting, Petroleum, NYSE, WLL, filing, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, restructure, debt, early, April, 
The, company, continue, going, interest, emerge, bankruptcy, much, stronger, balance, sheet, exchanging, 2, 2, billion, debt, equity, But, common, shareholders, see, 97, stake, company, evaporate, courts, approve, deal, likely, lenders, 
Whiting, may, first, big, independent, producers, wipe, investors, unlikely, prove, Chesapeake, Energy, OTC, CHKA, Q, cusp, financial, trouble, since, well, oil, crash, could, serious, trouble, sooner, rather, later, 
The, list, gets, longer, deeper, go, Here, several, independent, producer, balance, sheets, compare, Whiting, Chesapeake, 
WLL, FINANCIAL, DEBT, TO, EBITDA, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
That, massive, amount, debt, leverage, particularly, consider, much, earnings, set, fall, current, oil, price, environment, For, context, leveraged, plenty, producers, really, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, sports, debt, EBITDA, ratio, earnings, interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, 1, 1, 12, 5, debt, assets, ratio, Not, mention, diversity, operations, give, sources, cash, flow, oil, prices, crater, 
Simply, put, pure, play, producers, already, ton, debt, trouble, Oil, prices, 60, since, first, quarter, back, 24, per, barrel, Most, producers, need, 40, oil, cover, costs, much, less, make, profit, 
Even, massive, cuts, like, made, Apache, NASDAQ, APA, capital, spending, dividend, go, far, keep, lenders, bay, Occidental, NYSE, OXY, 3, billion, cash, quarter, end, margin, safety, producers, even, carry, enough, cash, cover, single, quarter, operating, expenses, 
If, overleveraged, producer, good, luck, getting, bankers, take, call, right, Bankruptcy, could, prove, path, forward, many, producers, next, couple, quarters, 
Like, industries, subject, big, cyclical, shifts, demand, companies, best, balance, sheets, ability, scale, operations, diversity, operations, tend, make, best, investments, That, certainly, case, oil, industry, 
The, reason, Simply, put, companies, ability, survive, extended, downturn, ones, generate, value, Start, reducing, downside, risks, first, capturing, returns, 
In, oil, industry, means, integrated, majors, Top, companies, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, aforementioned, ExxonMobil, along, non, producer, still, highly, integrated, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, 
Here, four, compare, highly, leveraged, producers, 
CVX, FINANCIAL, DEBT, TO, EBITDA, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
There, value, preservation, aspect, Independent, oil, producers, count, oil, reserves, biggest, asset, With, oil, prices, 60, many, producers, forced, write, value, holdings, near, future, That, erode, value, access, capital, 
It, worth, noting, integrated, major, significant, downstream, segments, deal, thing, lesser, degree, They, continue, pipelines, refineries, petrochemicals, facilities, producers, still, need, turn, oil, money, assets, hold, value, much, better, Phillips, 66, operate, oil, production, dodge, issue, completely, reason, still, pick, biggest, winner, 
In, addition, lower, leverage, integrated, majors, also, substantial, liquidity, reserves, Shell, ended, quarter, 18, billion, cash, equivalents, Chevron, 5, 75, billion, ExxonMobil, 3, 1, billion, When, start, adding, low, cost, debt, tap, numbers, get, even, bigger, Even, Phillips, 66, 1, 6, billion, cash, another, 5, billion, credit, management, access, moment, notice, 
That, category, integrated, majors, seen, stock, prices, hold, much, better, independent, producers, 
CVX, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
But, chart, shows, still, tremendous, upside, along, lower, risk, permanent, losses, For, instance, Shell, ExxonMobil, Phillips, 66, share, prices, would, almost, double, get, back, less, three, ago, Chevron, stock, would, gain, 50, fully, recover, 
Don, make, mistake, assuming, value, found, oil, patch, result, quick, buck, Oil, prices, likely, bounce, back, anytime, soon, least, sustained, way, even, see, major, cuts, global, oil, producers, soon, 
The, crash, global, oil, demand, going, extreme, creating, bigger, short, term, problem, nowhere, put, oil, produced, That, could, send, oil, prices, falling, even, producers, scramble, shut, production, fill, every, storage, facility, available, brim, And, excess, oil, create, bigger, problem, adding, long, takes, industry, recover, 
Add, investors, race, quickly, oil, stocks, could, also, lose, another, way, opportunity, cost, I, expect, plenty, investors, hold, oil, stocks, waiting, recovery, plenty, sectors, economy, bounce, back, return, full, strength, much, sooner, 
So, rush, oil, patch, looking, load, bargains, consider, value, oil, recovery, could, take, lot, longer, sectors, even, best, capitalized, companies, might, deliver, returns, expect, quick, want, 
Following, slow, steady, climb, stock, market, Wall, Street, firmly, reminded, past, 7, weeks, equities, move, directions, Since, Feb, 19, witnessed, 
We, also, witnessed, truly, unprecedented, unemployment, data, wake, coronavirus, disease, 2019, COVID, 19, weekly, jobless, claims, totaling, 10, million, past, two, weeks, The, previous, two, week, record, dating, back, many, decades, 1, 4, million, jobless, claims, 
Suffice, say, investors, resolve, tested, like, never, 
However, also, potential, generation, opportunity, put, money, work, market, considerably, attractive, valuations, After, every, single, correction, bear, market, history, eventually, erased, bull, market, rally, Patient, investors, give, investment, thesis, time, play, often, handsomely, rewarded, 
The, thing, brokerage, commissions, largely, eliminated, longer, sitting, mountain, cash, make, money, stock, market, Even, taking, 100, disposable, cash, e, money, need, pay, bills, emergency, fund, opening, position, following, four, stocks, right, could, put, path, toward, financial, freedom, 
Even, though, bank, stocks, probably, toward, bottom, investors, buy, lists, moment, I, believe, time, turn, blind, eye, efficient, big, bank, entire, industry, U, S, Bancorp, NYSE, USB, 
Without, question, banks, expected, see, reduction, net, interest, income, given, Federal, Reserve, moved, federal, funds, rate, back, time, low, They, also, likely, see, modest, rise, loan, delinquencies, people, work, due, COVID, 19, But, long, term, worries, historically, conservative, bank, like, U, S, Bancorp, avoided, risky, bets, almost, entirely, leaned, loan, deposit, growth, bolster, bottom, line, 
Among, big, banks, U, S, Bancorp, consistently, top, comes, return, assets, ROA, done, excellent, job, pushing, members, use, digital, banking, mobile, applications, This, digital, push, allows, U, S, Bancorp, close, branches, thereby, lowering, noninterest, expenses, upping, ROA, With, stock, cheaper, decade, relative, book, value, time, pounce, 
For, past, marijuana, absolute, dud, investment, especially, Canada, regulatory, issues, created, everything, shortages, product, huge, supply, bottlenecks, key, provinces, But, clear, cut, winner, pot, industry, Canada, money, OrganiGram, Holdings, NASDAQ, OGI, 
Perhaps, biggest, advantage, OrganiGram, brings, table, operating, single, facility, Moncton, New, Brunswick, Having, one, cultivation, processing, center, means, lot, easier, company, manage, supply, chain, expenses, adjust, production, meet, domestic, demand, 
It, also, hurt, OrganiGram, projected, peak, output, around, 230, grams, per, square, foot, That, roughly, two, three, times, higher, peers, This, company, utilizing, three, tiered, growing, system, Moncton, thereby, maximizing, close, 500, 000, square, feet, available, cultivation, space, 
The, ride, could, bumpy, near, term, Canadian, licensed, producer, generated, nonsense, operating, profit, deserves, investors, portfolios, 
There, denying, oil, stocks, rocked, 2020, freefall, demand, crude, subsequent, price, war, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, But, integrated, oil, gas, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, built, survive, relatively, short, term, shocks, energy, market, 
One, keys, ExxonMobil, success, integrated, operations, Although, makes, bulk, margins, upstream, operations, drilling, exploration, company, downstream, operations, refining, chemicals, act, hedge, Typically, price, crude, declines, becomes, profitable, refine, petrol, products, Once, passed, worst, COVID, 19, pandemic, downstream, operations, come, particularly, handy, ExxonMobil, 
This, also, company, plenty, levers, pull, cost, department, Having, initially, set, capital, expenditure, budget, 30, billion, 33, billion, 2020, would, difficult, ExxonMobil, shave, billions, capital, plans, It, also, paid, 14, 6, billion, dividends, 2019, could, consider, shrinking, payout, conserve, cash, 
In, short, ExxonMobil, tools, long, term, winner, fossil, fuels, 
Investors, also, consider, taking, 100, opening, position, companion, pet, insurance, provider, Trupanion, NASDAQ, TRUP, 
The, insurance, industry, far, sexy, good, making, money, given, typically, strong, pricing, power, insurers, But, companion, pet, market, offers, truly, unique, scenario, given, relatively, untapped, Only, 1, 2, North, American, pet, owners, currently, medical, insurance, four, legged, family, members, opening, door, exceptionally, long, runway, growth,
