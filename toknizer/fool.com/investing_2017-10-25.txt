It, going, busy, day, oil, gas, industry, three, sector, biggest, companies, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, France, Total, SA, NYSE, TOT, report, third, quarter, 2017, earnings, Friday, Oct, 27, With, Halloween, around, corner, investors, hoping, treats, tricks, oil, majors, 
But, tricky, keep, track, giant, corporations, Here, one, simple, thing, investors, watch, companies, earnings, reports, 
OFFSHORE, OIL, AND, GAS, DRILLING, IS, KEY, TO, THE, OIL, MAJORS, OUTPERFORMANCE, OR, LACK, THEREOF, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
In, recent, quarters, ExxonMobil, struggled, production, volumes, decline, unlike, happening, Total, Chevron, 
The, market, pretty, cool, Exxon, Despite, company, generous, 3, 7, current, dividend, yield, improved, second, quarter, earnings, Mr, Market, already, shaved, 7, 9, company, shares, far, 2017, Upbeat, production, guidance, could, help, reverse, trend, lieu, oil, price, increases, seem, unlikely, 
It, sort, puzzling, considering, good, Exxon, looking, otherwise, Management, conservative, strategies, helped, company, maintain, solid, balance, sheet, downstream, operations, profitable, current, low, oil, price, environment, Yet, stock, still, seems, mired, bargain, territory, 
Long, term, production, may, looking, Exxon, thanks, part, massive, new, offshore, discovery, South, America, Unfortunately, today, investors, oil, start, flowing, new, find, 2020, In, meantime, investors, may, stomach, production, declines, 
Chevron, certainly, concerned, production, volume, surged, 10, second, quarter, thanks, major, projects, came, online, As, result, company, cash, flow, operations, surged, nearly, doubling, 2, 5, billion, Q2, 2016, 5, billion, Q2, 2017, That, enabled, Chevron, cover, capital, spending, cash, flow, operations, It, almost, managed, cover, dividend, payouts, 
So, big, question, Chevron, keep, one, quarter, blip, 
Chevron, managed, push, quarterly, capital, expenditures, progressively, lower, past, three, They, peaked, 11, billion, 2014, dropped, 3, 2, billion, Q2, That, partly, due, big, projects, came, online, Q2, converting, capital, expenses, income, generators, And, done, much, new, capital, spending, interim, So, expect, could, continue, improve, possibly, even, fully, covering, capital, spending, dividend, cash, flow, operations, That, would, big, win, company, investors, 
Total, seem, worried, capital, spending, In, fact, Q2, 2017, earnings, release, CEO, Patrick, Pouyanne, touted, thanks, improved, balance, sheet, company, flexibility, take, advantage, low, cost, environment, able, launch, profitable, projects, acquire, resources, attractive, conditions, 
In, plain, English, Pouyanne, seemed, hinting, spending, binge, way, Sure, enough, third, quarter, Total, announced, plans, purchase, Maersk, Oil, 7, 45, billion, transaction, paid, combination, Total, stock, assumption, Maersk, Oil, debt, The, transaction, would, significantly, increase, Total, North, Sea, assets, The, company, anticipates, transaction, close, early, 2018, 
In, addition, Total, bought, several, deepwater, Gulf, Mexico, plays, operated, Chevron, acquired, energy, efficiency, company, Greenflex, quarter, In, early, October, company, also, announced, acquisition, additional, offshore, exploration, blocks, Guinea, 
However, Q2, company, already, acquired, offshore, exploration, blocks, Ireland, Mauritania, Senegal, Gabon, well, announcing, would, develop, major, phase, 11, South, Pars, gas, field, Iran, 
That, lot, new, activities, maybe, much, Even, strong, balance, sheet, Total, probably, going, prioritize, projects, others, Investors, pay, attention, activities, Pouyanne, highlights, top, priority, whether, indicates, company, spending, binge, likely, continue, 
For, three, companies, investors, look, overall, performance, Oil, prices, largely, held, steady, far, Exxon, Chevron, Total, able, continue, remain, profitable, cash, flow, positive, price, environment, indicate, able, continue, It, also, give, investors, sense, oil, majors, Royal, Dutch, Shell, BP, may, fare, report, earnings, next, week, 
However, important, realize, oil, majors, mean, necessarily, fare, That, looking, ExxonMobil, production, volume, Chevron, fiscal, discipline, Total, spending, plans, also, important, part, equation, investors, consider, deciding, whether, buy,
