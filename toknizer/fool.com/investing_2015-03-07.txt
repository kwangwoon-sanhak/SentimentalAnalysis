A, much, bigger, question, mark, however, absence, energy, dividend, paying, Goliath, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Buffett, 13F, filing, 
In, recent, interview, CNBC, Buffett, admitted, abandoning, 3, 68, billion, stake, The, Oracle, Omaha, declared, decision, sell, ExxonMobil, stake, based, fact, current, earning, power, diminished, significantly, ago, true, oil, companies, thought, might, uses, money, 
Selling, massive, stake, ExxonMobil, smaller, stake, ConocoPhilips, suggest, Buffett, believe, crude, oil, prices, recover, anytime, soon, If, investors, take, away, could, fade, rallies, energy, stocks, 
George, Soros, 
While, Buffett, much, willing, companies, long, haul, billionaire, hedge, fund, legend, George, Soros, tends, trade, stocks, often, 
Soros, revolving, door, approach, means, companies, buys, sells, given, quarter, could, well, sold, bought, next, quarter, However, still, worth, keeping, eye, Soros, market, movements, given, among, industry, best, money, managers, decades,

David, Einhorn, 
Einhorn, worth, watching, two, reasons, First, turned, 900, 000, grub, stake, Greenlight, Capital, long, short, hedge, fund, 7, 8, billion, management, Secondly, Einhorn, proven, savvy, investor, made, stellar, investment, calls, including, accurate, prediction, 2008, Wall, Street, Lehman, Brothers, doomed, 
Unlike, Soros, Einhorn, chose, hang, onto, Apple, stake, fourth, quarter, unwind, slate, positions, 
His, biggest, sale, unloading, 250, million, position, health, insurer, Cigna, Corporation, NYSE, CI, He, also, punted, 124, million, stake, American, Capital, Agency, Corp, 121, million, position, National, Oilwell, Varco, 
The, Cigna, sale, intriguing, occurred, Obamacare, second, open, enrollment, period, kicking, That, could, mean, Einhorn, decided, Cigna, 17, 7, return, last, good, enough, book, ahead, uncertainty, tied, second, open, enrollment, period, Supreme, Court, decision, hear, pivotal, case, questioning, validity, Obamacare, subsidies, 
Einhorn, decision, part, ways, American, Capital, may, similarly, made, simply, good, time, lock, solid, return, American, Capital, shares, jumped, 31, last, However, Einhorn, selling, National, Oilwell, may, best, Despite, shares, falling, 6, 6, 2014, collapsing, crude, prices, forced, National, Oilwell, shares, another, 16, 5, 
Tying, together, 
A, long, term, approach, focus, investors, however, knowing, stocks, long, haul, tricky, Sometimes, trends, change, investors, need, change, After, plenty, long, term, buy, holders, would, benefited, selling, shares, companies, like, Radio, Shack, Eastman, Kodak, point, along, way, 
Although, companies, gurus, unloaded, last, quarter, likely, end, dust, bin, like, two, decisions, sell, prompt, investors, revisit, reasons, long, make, sure, nothing, changed, would, suggest, selling, 
Before, consider, Apple, Inc, want, hear, 
Investing, legends, Motley, Fool, Co, founders, David, Tom, Gardner, revealed, believe, 10, best, stocks, investors, buy, right, Apple, Inc, one, 
Investing, perfect, science, If, would, filthy, rich, yacht, demolition, derbies, weekend, pass, time, Plenty, investments, pan, times, write, companies, turn, huge, winners, 
We, asked, three, energy, contributors, discuss, company, brushed, watch, stock, skyrocket, sat, sidelines, Here, say, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
XOM, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
LNG, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Oops, 
What, turned, hope, dream, CEO, Charif, Souki, viable, business, simple, fact, company, able, line, customers, left, right, sell, LNG, 20, take, pay, contracts, Those, contracts, guarantee, stable, revenue, stream, come, Sabine, Pass, Corpus, Christi, facilities, close, 70, processing, volumes, firm, contract, This, amount, certainty, made, much, easier, go, financiers, raise, capital, makes, company, look, much, interesting, investment, 
I, guessing, Souki, reads, one, laughing, sitting, massive, pile, money, 
HCLP, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
To, investing, either, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, making, pretty, much, bet, Don, tell, analysts, though, To, saying, two, companies, like, saying, root, Red, Sox, Yankees, time, 
So, brought, together, two, energy, analysts, take, opposite, sides, ExxonMobil, Chevron, debate, recorded, shouting, match, ensued, After, severe, editing, censoring, say, 
CVX, P, E, RATIO, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
CVX, DIVIDEND, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
XOM, RETURN, ON, CAPITAL, EMPLOYED, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
If, ask, whether, I, would, willing, pay, one, point, P, E, ratio, company, generates, return, equity, close, 6, percentage, points, higher, I, say, sign, 
2, Dividends, whole, story, While, Chevron, done, commendable, job, raising, dividend, although, needed, either, sell, assets, issue, debt, cover, dividend, payments, ExxonMobil, paid, dividends, using, organic, free, cash, flow, let, look, component, generating, shareholder, return, share, buybacks, On, top, keeping, pace, Chevron, dividend, increases, past, 10, ExxonMobil, also, reduced, total, share, count, one, third, Chevron, cut, total, shares, outstanding, shade, 10, 
XOM, AVERAGE, DILUTED, SHARES, OUTSTANDING, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
3, Growth, comes, production, Yes, production, oil, gas, earnings, powerhouse, pretty, much, every, integrated, oil, gas, company, called, integrated, reason, deal, every, part, value, chain, commodities, Over, next, several, ExxonMobil, looking, balance, portfolio, assets, investing, heavily, refining, chemical, manufacturing, facilities, One, projects, Baytown, ethylene, plant, cost, upward, 6, billion, running, 2017, Add, massive, chemical, lubricant, plant, expansions, Saudi, Arabia, Singapore, company, preparing, take, advantage, every, part, oil, gas, business, generate, profits, 
So, making, decision, investing, Chevron, ExxonMobil, keep, things, mind, With, better, returns, superior, return, cash, shareholders, stock, buybacks, dividends, paid, organic, free, cash, flow, balanced, portfolio, susceptible, oil, price, swings, I, think, ExxonMobil, clear, winner,
