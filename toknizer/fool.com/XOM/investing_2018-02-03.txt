It, seemed, like, every, day, 2017, full, despair, oil, investors, morning, morning, went, oil, prices, stubbornly, stuck, around, 50, barrel, Then, toward, end, prices, began, rising, hopes, finally, industry, turnaround, 
Now, looks, like, every, day, 2018, going, nail, biter, oil, investors, check, make, sure, price, oil, start, heading, back, Here, savvy, investors, want, keep, eye, 2018, look, independent, oil, gas, drillers, like, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, refiners, like, HollyFrontier, NYSE, HFC, integrated, majors, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
THE, STOCK, MARKET, SEEMS, TO, FINALLY, BE, REWARDING, OIL, STOCKS, AS, OIL, PRICES, MOVE, HIGHER, BUT, INVESTORS, SHOULD, KEEP, AN, EYE, ON, THINGS, AS, THEY, BUY, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
No, sector, oil, industry, dependent, oil, prices, E, Ps, insider, name, independent, oil, gas, exploration, production, companies, Because, directly, sell, crude, oil, produce, E, P, stocks, tend, first, ones, affected, price, oil, changes, They, drop, first, often, farthest, oil, prices, go, also, tend, rise, quickly, oil, prices, go, 
Take, ConocoPhillips, largest, U, S, E, P, Between, June, 2014, oil, price, dropped, end, Conoco, stock, took, 17, hit, ExxonMobil, lost, modest, 10, By, time, oil, stocks, hit, rock, bottom, January, 2016, Conoco, shares, lost, 59, value, Exxon, less, half, 28, 
However, opposite, also, true, Since, crude, oil, stocks, began, steadily, rising, August, 2017, Conoco, stock, appreciated, 30, Exxon, gone, less, 10, So, thing, watch, looking, E, Ps, price, oil, seems, headed, If, rise, least, stabilized, current, levels, Brent, Crude, WTI, crude, comfortably, 60, barrel, E, P, stocks, well, But, price, starts, dropping, surprised, see, panic, selling, market, prepared, snap, shares, cheap, 
No, crack, spread, weird, new, sandwich, topping, industry, calls, difference, purchase, price, crude, oil, selling, price, refined, petroleum, oil, refiners, make, money, 
Low, oil, prices, actually, good, petroleum, refiners, demand, stays, high, refined, petroleum, crack, spread, get, wide, indeed, In, fact, happened, HollyFrontier, 2017, busy, summer, driving, season, followed, Hurricane, Harvey, related, supply, disruptions, pushed, crack, spread, WTI, Crude, 30, barrel, range, 6, 17, 2016, Holly, took, advantage, running, refineries, 102, capacity, stock, reaped, benefit, rising, 50, 
However, rising, price, oil, putting, pressure, crack, spread, unlikely, match, 2017, levels, 2018, Not, mention, limit, much, capacity, refiner, squeeze, facilities, many, refiners, operating, peak, capacity, 2017, Those, refiners, facing, tough, comparable, ago, quarters, 2018, unlikely, banner, 2017, 
The, integrated, majors, largest, oil, companies, combine, exploration, production, activities, refining, also, selling, refined, products, During, oil, price, downturn, profitable, refining, selling, operations, subsidizing, oil, majors, underperforming, exploration, production, activities, Some, oil, majors, even, resort, offering, scrip, dividends, paying, dividends, shares, instead, cash, fund, payouts, 
Cost, cutting, measures, also, helped, oil, majors, able, push, breakeven, points, per, barrel, oil, price, would, turn, profit, 40, barrel, With, costs, still, low, price, oil, edging, higher, companies, ending, scrip, dividend, programs, even, eyeing, costlier, riskier, deepwater, investments, 
ExxonMobil, one, oil, major, With, low, breakeven, point, healthy, balance, sheet, company, made, extensive, offshore, investments, Guyana, seem, paying, But, ignoring, onshore, opportunities, either, In, fact, Exxon, recently, announced, expected, triple, Permian, Basin, production, 2025, 
The, combination, higher, margins, thanks, rising, oil, prices, cost, cutting, allow, many, oil, majors, expand, operations, pay, debt, make, acquisitions, raise, dividends, generally, benefit, shareholders, Each, individual, company, though, likely, prioritize, something, different, For, oil, majors, investors, keep, eye, whole, package, rather, one, two, elements, isolation, 
Analysts, expecting, good, things, oil, sector, 2018, higher, oil, prices, combine, successful, cost, cutting, measures, give, boost, companies, across, industry, However, concerns, stock, market, general, looks, expensive, right, may, lead, broader, market, pullback, If, happens, oil, stocks, could, get, caught, overall, downtrend, 
The, best, thing, though, invest, quality, companies, good, prospects, And, keeping, eye, oil, prices, crack, spreads, overall, performance, integrated, majors, great, way, figure, parts, oil, sector, give, best, bang, buck, 
Shares, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, fell, 5, 1, Feb, 2, While, lot, market, attention, 2, 1, 2, 5, drop, S, P, 500, Dow, Jones, Industrials, day, worst, single, day, indices, nearly, ExxonMobil, suffered, worst, single, day, since, 2011, 
The, biggest, driver, ExxonMobil, bad, day, fourth, quarter, earnings, release, left, analysts, investors, wanting, On, surface, 8, 4, billion, profit, might, look, good, almost, 6, billion, one, time, benefit, related, Tax, Act, federal, tax, legislation, passed, late, 2017, lowering, corporate, income, tax, rate, Adjusting, one, time, non, cash, gain, ExxonMobil, reported, 0, 88, per, share, profits, well, 1, 03, looking, 
The, lower, tax, rate, provide, recurring, boost, ExxonMobil, going, forward, substantial, gain, company, recorded, fourth, quarter, far, higher, company, actually, realize, future, quarters, new, tax, law, investors, pay, attention, adjusted, results, 
But, big, part, story, investors, ignore, company, oil, production, declined, fourth, quarter, falling, 130, 000, barrels, 3, 2, lot, decline, North, America, Actually, U, S, production, fell, 244, 000, barrels, growth, areas, offsetting, declines, The, company, started, reprioritize, U, S, production, recently, announced, earnings, would, invest, 50, billion, U, S, next, five, 
It, great, past, ExxonMobil, investors, Shares, 20, 2014, peak, also, time, high, soundly, beaten, rest, market, every, turn, past, decade, 
XOM, TOTAL, RETURN, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
And, 32, 5, total, returns, low, point, mid, 2015, S, P, 500, delivered, 54, total, returns, period, 
So, mean, future, It, hard, say, Historically, ExxonMobil, delivered, best, returns, capital, assets, energy, industry, seems, scale, delivering, investors, past, At, time, represents, intriguing, value, particularly, plans, reignite, growth, U, S, boost, bottom, line, Tax, Act, provide, 
I, ready, count, biggest, Big, Oil, players, yet, I, think, better, investments, energy, sector, today, starting, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, Shell, may, cheap, growth, plan, working, yields, 47, higher, payout, dividend, 5, 3, versus, 3, 6, ExxonMobil, 
My, suggestion, keep, ExxonMobil, watchlist, take, closer, look, Shell, money, want, invest, If, ExxonMobil, stabilize, production, start, growing, earnings, cash, flows, may, worth, buying, It, today,
