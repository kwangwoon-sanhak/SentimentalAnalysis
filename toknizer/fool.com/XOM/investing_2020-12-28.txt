This, past, might, go, worst, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, history, Thanks, cratering, oil, prices, oil, giant, lost, billions, dollars, third, quarter, expected, record, historic, writedown, approaching, 20, billion, fourth, quarter, Exxon, therefore, failed, increase, dividend, first, time, decades, As, result, stock, price, cratered, 40, caused, briefly, lose, title, country, largest, oil, company, 
However, brutal, nearly, books, time, look, ahead, 2021, might, bring, Here, case, seeing, oil, giant, bounce, back, coming, 
The, main, issue, weighing, ExxonMobil, stock, 2020, oil, prices, tumbled, 20, COVID, 19, outbreak, torpedoed, demand, That, slump, cut, Exxon, cash, flow, forcing, slash, capital, spending, borrow, heavily, bridge, gap, 
However, 2021, could, better, oil, prices, First, industry, watchers, expect, oil, demand, recover, sharply, 2021, For, example, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, anticipates, gasoline, oil, demand, particularly, strong, 2021, returning, 99, pre, pandemic, levels, That, benefit, Exxon, oil, production, business, refining, assets, As, result, generate, cash, 2021, could, help, take, pressure, stock, price, 
Another, potential, catalyst, company, coming, improvement, balance, sheet, Exxon, total, debt, rose, 20, billion, third, quarter, 2019, period, However, Exxon, completed, review, forward, business, plan, late, 2020, see, prioritize, investments, highest, value, assets, As, result, company, plans, sell, less, strategic, ones, future, would, give, cash, repay, debt, 
If, oil, prices, Exxon, balance, sheet, improve, 2021, help, lift, weight, Exxon, stock, price, could, bounce, back, sharply, 
While, reason, believe, coming, could, much, better, one, ExxonMobil, stock, downside, risks, bear, watching, Topping, list, potential, oil, prices, might, recover, much, coming, Two, factors, could, affect, oil, prices, 
First, one, potential, drivers, rebound, oil, consumption, anticipation, vaccines, roll, quickly, 2021, putting, end, pandemic, However, might, take, lot, longer, expected, get, virus, control, since, vaccines, might, run, production, issues, transportation, problems, resistance, large, swaths, population, ineffectiveness, virus, mutates, That, could, force, governments, continue, restricting, travel, would, affect, oil, demand, 
On, hand, producers, might, start, adding, back, supply, quickly, could, keep, lid, oil, prices, As, stands, right, IEA, expects, take, economy, full, burn, current, excess, inventory, Thus, producers, restart, pumps, soon, could, cause, storage, levels, balloon, push, prices, lower, 
In, addition, potential, oil, market, issues, Exxon, faces, internal, headwinds, might, keep, lid, stock, price, 2021, For, starters, company, significantly, reduced, capital, spending, probably, cause, production, decline, coming, Meanwhile, might, trouble, selling, assets, could, affect, ability, repay, debt, If, happens, company, might, choice, reduce, dividend, 
On, one, hand, seems, reasonable, believe, ExxonMobil, stock, could, rebound, 2021, If, vaccines, give, global, economy, shot, arm, causing, oil, demand, prices, bounce, back, oil, stocks, like, Exxon, follow, 
However, plenty, downside, risks, remain, oil, market, On, top, oil, market, might, recover, Exxon, could, continue, sputter, business, underperforms, expectations, balance, sheet, improve, It, sure, thing, Exxon, stock, bounces, back, coming, 
The, shift, toward, clean, energy, leading, investors, question, future, demand, fossil, fuels, contrarians, might, find, time, invest, sector, According, BP, 84, world, energy, needs, still, met, fossil, fuels, means, even, usage, declines, demand, remain, enormous, Clean, energy, might, future, fossil, fuels, present,

Consider, fossil, fuels, still, provide, 84, world, energy, needs, All, world, planes, fly, fossil, fuel, How, long, would, take, retire, current, planes, replace, say, solar, powered, planes, How, much, money, would, cost, industry, already, decimated, pandemic, 
The, vast, majority, world, cars, gasoline, powered, And, even, California, perhaps, progressive, state, allotted, decade, half, mandating, 2035, new, car, sales, zero, emission, vehicles, 
The, cost, solar, wind, power, declined, two, thirds, past, decade, making, increasingly, attractive, energy, source, But, even, aggressive, proposals, shuttering, coal, plants, forecast, rather, lengthy, 15, transition, period, And, coal, seems, slow, decline, natural, gas, remains, popular, In, 2019, third, newly, constructed, U, S, power, plants, powered, natural, gas, 
In, words, even, world, wanted, abandon, fossil, fuels, would, take, many, decades, But, likelihood, whole, world, fact, want, move, clean, energy, Consider, The, energy, sector, responsible, 10, Canadian, economy, measured, gross, domestic, product, GDP, In, Saudi, Arabia, share, even, higher, 50, GDP, comes, oil, gas, Russia, world, second, largest, natural, gas, producer, third, largest, producer, oil, Do, countries, want, world, move, away, fossil, fuels, Probably, 
Structural, demand, fossil, fuels, provides, intermediate, term, support, In, shorter, run, International, Energy, Agency, estimates, pandemic, reduced, global, energy, demand, 5, While, fallout, COVID, 19, likely, felt, several, effective, vaccines, eventually, lead, resumption, normal, work, leisure, travel, could, lead, higher, energy, demand, And, increased, demand, would, occur, right, time, supply, shrinking, 
Last, spring, price, collapse, COVID, related, demand, declines, resulted, 35, North, American, energy, producers, declaring, bankruptcy, second, third, quarters, 2020, reduce, future, supply, And, OPEC, organization, represents, combination, OPEC, non, OPEC, oil, producing, nations, Russia, recently, lowered, planned, 2021, oil, supply, increase, 2, million, barrels, per, day, 0, 5, million, barrels, per, day, These, future, supply, reductions, likely, help, support, prices, demand, recovers, 
Even, price, energy, stocks, stagnates, near, term, investors, cases, getting, paid, well, wait, Beaten, prices, combined, steady, dividend, payouts, resulted, especially, high, dividend, yields, 
Between, 2015, end, 2019, dividend, yield, Exxon, NYSE, XOM, fluctuated, 3, 4, 5, Early, 2020, yield, jumped, 5, 8, today, stands, 8, 35, Chevron, currently, yields, NYSE, CVX, 6, 03, bouncing, 3, 5, 5, previous, five, Looking, abroad, BP, NYSE, BP, yielding, 6, 11, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, yields, lower, still, attractive, 3, 78, 
Of, course, energy, prices, profits, remain, low, guarantee, companies, able, maintain, current, dividend, payments, Over, past, decade, Exxon, covered, 67, dividend, payments, free, cash, flow, For, Chevron, number, 52, BP, 25, Shell, comparative, winner, even, 80, dividends, covered, free, cash, flow, The, remainder, shareholder, payouts, come, borrowing, asset, sales, reductions, cash, reserves, And, figures, cover, period, 2019, The, impact, pandemic, exacerbate, challenges, companies, faced, past, decade,
