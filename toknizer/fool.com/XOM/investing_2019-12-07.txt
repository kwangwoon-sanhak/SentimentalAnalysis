ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, treated, investors, like, royalty, The, energy, company, grown, dividend, average, annual, rate, 6, 2, past, 37, increasing, every, single, timeframe, That, puts, elite, class, Dividend, Aristocrat, 
However, Exxon, excellent, dividend, stock, necessarily, mean, one, future, To, gauge, potential, need, dig, bit, deeper, looking, sustainability, current, payout, also, growth, prospects, Here, look, whether, Exxon, maintain, status, top, tier, dividend, stock, 
Exxon, dividend, currently, clocks, 5, 1, yield, well, 2, average, stocks, S, P, 500, While, higher, yields, often, imply, higher, risk, case, Exxon, payout, Through, third, quarter, oil, giant, generated, hefty, 23, 4, billion, cash, flow, operating, activities, enough, cover, roughly, 11, billion, paid, dividends, While, cash, flow, 27, 4, billion, ago, period, volatility, oil, gas, market, company, still, generated, lots, excess, cash, paying, dividend, invest, expansion, projects, 
Exxon, however, invested, 22, 7, billion, expansions, far, outspending, cash, flow, wide, margin, That, design, though, company, middle, ambitious, long, term, growth, program, It, bridging, gap, selling, assets, using, top, tier, balance, sheet, Overall, company, sold, 4, 8, billion, assets, ahead, pace, achieve, target, selling, 15, billion, assets, 2021, 
With, business, generating, gusher, cash, top, tier, balance, sheet, active, asset, sale, program, Exxon, high, yielding, dividend, appears, sustainable, footing, 
Exxon, multiyear, expansion, program, increase, output, 1, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, D, 2025, That, implies, 25, increase, 2017, baseline, level, huge, jump, large, oil, producer, The, company, believes, investments, grow, upstream, production, well, downstream, refining, chemicals, businesses, fuel, 140, surge, earnings, cash, flow, 2025, 2017, level, That, assumes, global, oil, price, benchmark, Brent, stays, around, average, 60, barrel, 
Exxon, investing, several, major, projects, around, world, including, Permian, Basin, offshore, Guyana, These, projects, boast, ultra, low, production, costs, enable, company, generate, healthy, cash, flow, growth, even, oil, prices, decline, In, Permian, Basin, example, earn, 10, return, investments, new, wells, oil, price, less, 35, per, barrel, Meanwhile, offshore, Guyana, produce, return, around, 40, barrel, Because, low, costs, Exxon, grow, cash, flow, 55, 2025, even, oil, averages, 40, barrel, Given, view, company, plenty, fuel, keep, growing, dividend, especially, since, crude, oil, currently, plan, 63, barrel, 
Exxon, base, plan, would, see, grow, cash, flow, 7, per, 2025, assuming, oil, prices, remain, roughly, flat, around, 60, barrel, Meanwhile, still, grow, cash, flow, healthy, rate, even, crude, slumps, 40, barrel, Because, cash, flow, growth, healthy, balance, sheet, seems, likely, Exxon, able, continue, increasing, high, yield, dividend, That, makes, great, stock, income, seeking, investors, 
Oil, companies, like, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, taking, double, hit, lately, First, oil, prices, relatively, weak, several, Second, carbon, based, fuels, increasing, scrutiny, due, effect, climate, These, two, key, reasons, Chevron, dividend, yield, 4, But, get, stuck, negatives, positives, consider, suggest, actually, good, time, dividend, investors, put, Chevron, buy, list, 
Oil, volatile, commodity, prone, big, price, swings, But, Chevron, well, aware, industry, operates, works, long, focused, maintaining, strong, balance, sheet, This, financial, foundation, company, within, energy, sector, Chevron, balance, sheet, among, strongest, 
To, put, numbers, company, financial, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, 0, 15, That, low, number, industry, particularly, conservative, energy, sector, Although, fellow, oil, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, financial, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, peers, sit, twice, level, This, normal, trend, Chevron, historically, taking, conservative, approach, regard, leverage, That, flows, company, interest, coverage, pay, interest, expenses, 24, times, Exxon, times, interest, earned, ratio, touch, better, Chevron, sits, others, group, 
The, big, takeaway, Chevron, plenty, room, balance, sheet, add, debt, industry, downturn, requires, That, oil, prices, plummeted, 100, barrel, mid, 2014, 30, early, 2016, Prices, today, 50, 60, range, Chevron, actually, able, keep, trimming, debt, So, despite, tough, market, energy, giant, looks, like, pretty, solid, financial, ground, 
There, question, oil, prices, volatile, lately, commodity, trading, range, makes, tough, industry, participants, turn, profit, Smaller, players, going, belly, environment, particularly, U, S, onshore, space, In, fact, Reuters, reports, law, firm, Haynes, Boone, believes, bankruptcies, pace, reach, levels, last, seen, 2016, oil, prices, finally, started, bounce, lows, following, 2014, downturn, 
Chevron, bankruptcy, list, strong, balance, sheet, But, another, factor, consider, Chevron, believes, cash, flow, break, even, point, roughly, 51, per, barrel, That, low, end, current, oil, price, range, better, peers, So, actually, relatively, well, positioned, cover, expenses, within, oil, environment, operating, 
Another, positive, Chevron, capital, spending, plans, growing, materially, In, fact, expects, spend, around, 20, billion, 2023, roughly, spent, since, 2018, Exxon, reference, ramping, spending, reverse, production, decline, But, take, mean, Chevron, backing, away, production, growth, opposite, going, production, expected, increase, average, 3, 4, next, five, Put, simply, Chevron, expecting, spend, less, rivals, yet, continue, grow, business, That, pretty, desirable, position, 
So, Chevron, looks, well, positioned, oil, industry, relatively, low, costs, production, growing, strong, enough, balance, sheet, handle, adversity, needs, So, far, good, income, oriented, investors, But, long, term, problem, needs, examined, carbon, Oil, natural, gas, carbon, based, fuels, expected, displaced, time, cleaner, alternatives, like, electricity, generated, solar, wind, The, big, question, however, 
At, point, industry, watchers, expect, oil, natural, gas, remain, important, contributors, world, energy, needs, decades, come, Exxon, made, point, highlighting, long, energy, transitions, take, need, build, infrastructure, oil, requiring, roughly, century, displace, coal, Royal, Dutch, Shell, meanwhile, noted, someone, supply, world, oil, still, demanding, Notably, companies, keep, drilling, appears, bigger, risk, world, little, oil, That, doubly, true, given, countries, able, meet, carbon, reduction, goals, set, 
Accoring, Chevron, long, term, forecast, image, appears, new, supplies, 550, billion, barrels, oil, 2, 100, trillion, cubic, feet, natural, gas, needed, meet, demand, current, regulations, That, means, drilling, And, even, world, comes, together, limit, carbon, emissions, still, looks, like, new, supplies, 370, billion, barrels, oil, 1, 750, trillion, cubic, feet, natural, gas, needed, Once, means, drilling, Yes, producing, carbon, fuels, issue, Wall, Street, appears, overreacting, risks, 
IMAGE, SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, 
At, point, oil, natural, gas, look, though, face, major, threat, alternatives, long, time, Eventually, oil, natural, gas, fall, favor, right, world, still, needs, fuels, large, quantities, 
Income, investors, looking, reliable, dividend, stock, consider, Chevron, It, risk, free, investment, means, 4, yield, attractive, high, side, historical, range, past, 20, It, appears, well, positioned, financially, within, industry, And, carbon, issue, threat, looks, like, material, headwind, many, All, told, appears, pretty, good, time, consider, adding, Chevron, dividend, portfolio,
