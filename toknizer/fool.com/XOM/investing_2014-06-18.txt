In, last, article, Linn, Energy, I, explained, I, believe, Linn, Co, NASDAQ, LNCO, MLP, counterpart, Linn, Energy, OTC, LINEQ, excellent, long, term, high, yield, income, investments, One, main, arguments, supporting, stance, Linn, Energy, looking, trade, Midland, Basin, assets, would, steep, cost, drill, assets, already, producing, This, would, increase, production, lowering, costs, greatly, increase, distributable, cash, flow, DCF, secure, Linn, Energy, generous, 10, yield, On, May, 21, Linn, Energy, indeed, announced, deal, oil, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, careful, study, specifics, arrangement, I, believe, long, term, investment, thesis, three, substantially, stronger, 
Why, deal, great, companies, 
In, exchange, 25, 000, net, acres, Midland, Basin, properties, Linn, Energy, producing, 2, 000, barrels, day, ExxonMobil, giving, 500, 000, net, acres, Hugoton, field, Kansas, gas, reserves, 700, billion, cubic, feet, gas, currently, producing, 85, million, cubic, feet, day, MMcf, natural, gas, 
For, Linn, Energy, deal, advantageous, several, reasons, 
In, addition, securing, current, distribution, likely, setting, strong, growth, ahead, deal, netted, Linn, Energy, East, Goldsmith, field, 24, million, barrels, reserves, enhanced, oil, recovery, EOR, project, uses, CO2, injection, increase, well, pressure, results, super, low, decline, high, margin, oil, production, 
Linn, Energy, also, receives, Jayhawk, gas, plant, 450, MMcf, processing, facility, located, heart, Hugoton, basin, already, processing, Linn, Energy, gas, field, Jayhawk, 44, utilized, new, production, Linn, Energy, able, achieve, much, higher, utilization, rates, synergistic, cost, savings, higher, margins, gas, production, 
What, exciting, Linn, Energy, investors, retains, 30, 000, net, acres, Midland, Basin, producing, 15, 000, barrels, day, 
Why, Midland, assets, valuable, Because, sit, Wolfcamp, Spraberry, shale, formations, Pioneer, Natural, Resources, believes, largest, recoverable, oil, deposits, earth, estimated, 75, billion, barrels, remaining, oil, ground, estimate, 50, since, 2013, 
This, real, reason, ExxonMobil, willing, trade, land, 20, 1, ratio, The, Hugoton, gas, formation, though, low, decline, 80, natural, gas, 20, natural, gas, liquids, 
Due, America, recent, shale, gas, explosion, current, lack, export, capabilities, natural, gas, prices, fluctuate, much, oil, prices, graphs, shows, BNO, Brent, Oil, considered, world, standard, price, 
HENRY, HUB, NATURAL, GAS, SPOT, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Thus, see, benefit, deal, companies, Linn, Energy, whose, recent, Berry, Petroleum, acquisition, ran, massive, cost, overruns, left, company, strapped, cash, holding, valuable, expensive, drill, land, traded, less, half, assets, ExxonMobil, company, bank, vault, safe, balance, sheet, plenty, cash, necessary, exploit, new, oil, rich, land, This, greatly, increases, ExxonMobil, reserves, future, production, potential, In, meantime, Linn, Energy, gains, substantial, increase, low, cost, low, decline, gas, production, generate, large, steady, cash, flows, secure, generous, yield, grow, future, 
Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, shareholders, excited, prospect, management, stellar, execution, long, term, plan, lower, costs, increasing, production, With, deal, plus, Exxon, downspacing, efforts, 570, 000, net, acres, Bakken, Shale, company, declining, exploration, production, capital, spending, ExxonMobil, setting, continued, double, digit, dividend, growth, 2016, 
With, track, record, 31, consecutive, dividend, growth, 7, 54, CAGR, dividend, growth, since, 1970, one, America, three, remaining, AAA, credit, ratings, better, U, S, government, long, term, dividend, growth, investors, look, potential, double, digit, dividend, growth, 2016, reason, buy, ExxonMobil, shares, 
Foolish, takeaway, 
The, specifics, deal, massively, beneficial, Linn, Energy, ExxonMobil, illustrate, two, premier, names, energy, sector, Linn, Energy, generous, yield, safe, set, grow, company, preserved, access, world, largest, oil, reserve, Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, gains, access, high, quality, oil, reserves, allow, grow, production, sufficiently, low, cost, continue, superb, dividend, growth, record,
