Integrated, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, producing, less, less, oil, three, consecutive, It, looks, like, growth, plans, started, bear, fruit, however, oil, company, U, S, onshore, drilling, starting, turn, numbers, around, recent, quarters, While, oil, gas, company, projects, tap, appears, Exxon, U, S, onshore, production, getting, started, Here, need, know, 
In, 2016, Exxon, average, daily, oil, equivalent, production, fell, roughly, 1, In, 2017, dropped, roughly, 1, 7, And, 2018, declined, additional, 3, 8, For, oil, company, producing, less, less, oil, good, trend, And, worse, appears, average, annual, numbers, problem, getting, worse, Add, production, fell, roughly, 6, 4, three,

Luckily, get, little, closer, numbers, things, look, quite, bad, For, example, although, average, annual, production, 2018, pretty, ugly, numbers, started, turn, higher, second, half, So, production, results, actually, started, improving, trend, carried, first, quarter, 2019, production, 5, 
The, main, driver, improvement, Exxon, efforts, onshore, U, S, market, Permian, drilling, efforts, started, produce, strong, results, It, number, large, offshore, projects, bright, futures, though, results, little, But, thing, Exxon, got, lot, room, run, Permian, 
In, 2018, Exxon, laid, expectations, onshore, U, S, drilling, effort, The, plan, produce, 600, 000, oil, equivalent, barrels, per, day, 2025, By, time, 2019, rolled, around, company, reported, materially, changed, projections, increasing, amount, oil, expects, produce, one, million, barrels, per, day, massive, 66, increase, stating, would, reach, new, higher, goal, one, earlier, 2024, 
Exxon, entered, 2019, producing, less, half, one, million, target, meaning, giant, oil, company, around, halfway, U, S, onshore, ambitions, So, look, lot, growth, company, U, S, operations, even, projects, start, come, line, But, end, story, 
During, company, first, quarter, 2019, conference, call, Senior, Vice, President, Jack, Williams, explained, 
This, volumes, ramp, supported, strong, well, inventory, In, fact, time, reach, 1, million, barrels, day, production, level, Permian, drilled, half, current, well, inventory, 
So, Exxon, pace, double, production, U, S, onshore, space, 2024, drilled, half, wells, planned, region, That, means, production, could, go, materially, higher, even, increasing, 100, next, four, And, equally, exciting, company, believes, achieve, 10, returns, region, even, oil, trading, hands, around, 35, per, barrel, 
There, complicating, factors, course, ensuring, enough, pipeline, capacity, handle, oil, There, little, point, drilling, wells, oil, produced, get, market, And, wells, company, drilling, U, S, onshore, space, often, called, unconventional, production, profile, projects, deepwater, wells, example, take, long, time, build, tend, produce, oil, fairly, steady, rate, long, time, U, S, onshore, wells, drilled, quickly, appear, shorter, lifespans, strong, burst, oil, followed, steadily, declining, results, least, using, current, technology, So, bright, future, Exxon, U, S, onshore, efforts, even, chooses, pull, back, current, pace, drilling, reasons, Still, region, investors, watch, closely, ahead, 
Exxon, U, S, onshore, growth, important, oil, gas, giant, The, quick, production, results, helping, balance, projects, take, little, longer, get, oil, flowing, With, plenty, production, growth, ahead, potential, even, reaching, current, goals, Exxon, appears, well, positioned, keep, production, heading, higher, future, That, big, change, recent, oil, giant, getting, started,
