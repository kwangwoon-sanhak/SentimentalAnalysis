You, seen, news, headlines, global, warming, carbon, based, fuels, like, oil, huge, piece, problem, That, hyperbole, That, scientific, fact, If, environmentalists, way, would, stop, using, older, energy, sources, today, rely, entirely, renewables, like, solar, wind, power, That, great, dream, pie, sky, dream, Oil, giant, BP, NYSE, BP, recently, explained, problem, goal, Here, need, know, understand, oil, giants, like, BP, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, still, putting, big, money, work, dirty, favor, industry, benefit, 
The, science, behind, global, warming, incontrovertible, The, process, burning, carbon, based, fuels, like, oil, releases, carbon, dioxide, increases, impact, greenhouse, effect, Humans, cause, greenhouse, effect, natural, process, gasses, Earth, atmosphere, trap, sun, heat, In, fact, without, greenhouse, effect, planet, would, much, colder, perhaps, quite, nice, live, 
The, problem, face, today, human, activity, appears, exacerbating, natural, process, increasing, amount, heat, trapped, Some, projections, future, suggest, Earth, heat, much, could, cause, severe, impact, planet, lifeforms, live, To, fair, making, projections, requires, lot, estimates, educated, guesses, It, would, understatement, say, difficult, make, kinds, long, range, predictions, This, largely, much, controversy, around, issue, Still, world, begun, adjust, solar, wind, power, growing, meaningfully, countries, around, world, look, reduce, use, carbon, fuels, 
Coal, impacted, electricity, increasingly, supported, cleaner, burning, lower, cost, natural, gas, That, transition, fuel, world, continues, build, alternative, energy, like, solar, wind, Electricity, meanwhile, increasingly, power, choice, even, automobiles, Which, means, oil, used, make, gasoline, also, facing, major, headwinds, So, green, Earth, would, investor, want, buy, oil, natural, gas, stock, like, BP, Exxon, 
It, laudable, goal, switch, carbon, based, fuels, clean, energy, one, achieved, overnight, Fuels, like, oil, natural, gas, integral, day, day, lives, simply, remove, In, fact, BP, Bernard, Looney, chief, executive, energy, giant, upstream, division, recently, highlighted, I, n, almost, every, scenario, oil, gas, together, forecast, represent, greater, 40, energy, mix, 2040, That, another, two, decades, two, sources, energy, remain, vital, contributors, world, energy, markets, 
BP, latest, projection, calls, global, oil, demand, rise, around, 100, million, barrels, oil, day, currently, roughly, 110, million, barrels, oil, 2040, This, assumes, gradual, transition, toward, cleaner, energy, sources, like, solar, wind, If, scenario, plays, problem, oil, companies, However, world, gets, aggressive, BP, projection, demand, 80, million, barrels, oil, per, day, That, would, problem, though, hardly, death, knell, industry, likely, outcome, since, requires, countries, actually, meet, targets, set, Paris, agreement, That, going, well, notably, United, States, pulling, deal, 
This, interesting, one, fact, investors, need, keep, mind, Oil, natural, gas, depleting, assets, Once, pull, barrel, oil, ground, gone, good, So, use, oil, natural, gas, need, find, new, sources, replace, fuel, used, This, small, issue, Using, conservative, estimates, BP, looked, global, production, would, look, like, oil, gas, exploration, stopped, right, Using, roughly, 3, annual, decline, rate, 2040, oil, production, would, roughly, 45, million, barrels, oil, day, That, well, even, 80, million, barrels, day, needed, aggressive, clean, energy, scenario, 
Which, outlook, energy, giants, like, BP, Exxon, bad, might, think, follow, media, coverage, global, warming, It, also, explains, BP, recently, paid, 10, 5, billion, acquire, onshore, U, S, energy, assets, BHP, Group, The, 470, 000, acres, land, holds, estimated, 4, 6, billion, barrels, oil, That, oil, BP, need, replace, oil, pulling, ground, today, BP, capital, spending, plans, call, investment, 14, billion, 15, billion, It, still, betting, big, oil, natural, gas, demand, depletion, dynamics, show, good, business, even, world, gets, increasingly, serious, global, warming, 
And, BP, alone, assessment, approach, For, example, Exxon, plans, spend, much, 30, billion, developing, onshore, U, S, energy, projects, offshore, oil, natural, gas, assets, The, goal, Exxon, push, production, higher, multiyear, period, production, dropping, But, big, picture, reason, investment, really, The, world, simply, stop, using, oil, natural, gas, Someone, keep, finding, new, supplies, companies, like, BP, Exxon, taking, challenge, 
XOM, DIVIDEND, YIELD, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Meanwhile, investors, collect, historically, high, dividend, yields, Exxon, around, 4, BP, around, 5, 6, It, worth, noting, BP, forced, cut, dividend, Deepwater, Horizon, disaster, 2010, dividend, history, nearly, impressive, Exxon, streak, 36, consecutive, dividend, hike, Conservative, investors, would, likely, prefer, Exxon, But, fairness, BP, changed, greatly, since, horrific, event, much, stronger, financial, ground, today, 
The, headline, risk, global, warming, real, However, efforts, deal, issue, likely, bad, big, oil, companies, including, BP, Exxon, investors, think, And, willing, take, contrarian, likely, realistic, view, energy, industry, collect, fat, dividends, two, oil, giants, continue, needed, supply, world, vital, oil, natural, gas, oil, gas, needed, even, best, case, scenario, globally, coordinated, effort, reduce, greenhouse, gas, emissions, If, global, warming, kept, oil, patch, might, want, reconsider, decision,
