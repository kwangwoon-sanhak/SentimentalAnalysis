They, fundamentally, great, long, term, investments, several, reasons, 
The, case, Exxon, 
Exxon, master, reserve, replacement, 20, consecutive, finding, oil, produces, Thanks, 2013, 103, reserve, replacement, rate, company, 25, 2, billion, barrels, proven, reserves, This, sufficient, cover, annual, production, 4, million, barrels, per, day, bpd, nearly, 14,

As, seen, Chevron, despite, safe, diversified, oil, giant, outperforms, Exxon, areas, investors, care, earnings, growth, profitability, yield, dividend, growth, 
Chevron, also, dividend, aristocrat, 25, consecutive, dividend, increases, 
However, largest, reason, investors, choose, Chevron, Exxon, company, near, term, growth, prospects, 
Over, next, four, Chevron, plans, increase, capacity, 20, 2, 6, mboe, 3, 1, mboe, It, plans, maintain, 2014, capex, rate, 35, 8, billion, time, spend, funds, deepwater, offshore, drilling, shale, oil, Tengizchevroil, consortium, This, last, project, partnership, companies, developing, Tengiz, super, giant, oil, field, Kazakhstan, Chevron, owns, 50, consortium,

Chevron, recent, price, weakness, result, earnings, warning, issued, company, Poor, weather, U, S, Canada, Kazakhstan, fourth, quarter, along, increased, refinery, maintenance, foreign, currency, effects, cause, company, miss, earnings, 0, 2, per, share, 
Investors, use, short, sighted, market, overreaction, accumulate, undervalued, shares, lock, historically, high, yield, probable, strong, dividend, growth, come, 
Foolish, takeaway, 
ExxonMobil, terrific, company, investors, likely, well, owning, shares, long, term, especially, given, undervalued, However, due, higher, yield, faster, dividend, growth, better, short, medium, term, growth, prospects, well, higher, profitability, equal, undervaluation, I, believe, Chevron, better, long, term, investment,
