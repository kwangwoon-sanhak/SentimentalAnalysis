Oil, stocks, crushed, past, couple, supply, buildup, caused, crude, prices, crash, That, crash, wiped, away, 1, trillion, equity, value, investors, portfolios, since, oil, prices, peaked, late, 2014, 
Those, losses, enough, make, investor, want, swear, oil, stocks, good, However, despite, sector, recent, turmoil, three, good, reasons, oil, stocks, make, smart, investments, 
Energy, prices, relatively, low, moment, prior, recent, downturn, oil, prices, painfully, elevated, noticeable, impact, disposable, income, For, example, according, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, average, U, S, household, spent, less, 4, budget, energy, needed, heating, cooking, personal, transportation, 2009, oil, averaged, 53, 48, per, barrel, 
However, household, spending, energy, jumped, 5, 2011, result, oil, averaging, 87, 04, per, barrel, For, average, American, household, spends, around, 53, 500, per, roughly, 500, impact, 
One, way, offset, future, impact, higher, oil, prices, invest, oil, stocks, hedge, rising, prices, A, great, way, take, savings, pump, lower, utility, bills, invest, top, oil, stock, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, oil, stock, ETF, Energy, Select, SPDR, ETF, NYSEMKT, XLE, 
That, ETF, counts, ExxonMobil, top, holding, holds, number, top, oil, stocks, including, oil, refiner, Valero, Energy, NYSE, VLO, oil, field, service, company, Halliburton, NYSE, HAL, top, 10, holdings, Energy, Select, SPDR, ETF, These, companies, stand, benefit, rising, oil, prices, demand, helping, hedge, future, increase, personal, energy, costs, 
For, lot, investors, often, generous, income, streams, oil, stocks, primary, reason, invested, sector, Prior, oil, price, crash, oil, stocks, fueling, billions, dollars, cash, investors, via, dividends, distributions, However, crash, oil, forced, many, oil, stocks, cut, investor, payouts, shareholders, losing, 7, 4, billion, dividend, income, alone, due, dividend, reductions, suspensions, 
Not, oil, stocks, cut, dividends, however, In, fact, ExxonMobil, Valero, Energy, continued, raise, payouts, downturn, In, Exxon, case, boosted, payout, 2, 7, earlier, continuing, streak, century, uninterrupted, dividends, oil, giant, increased, payout, past, 34, 
Meanwhile, Valero, Energy, increased, dividend, 20, earlier, That, top, 25, boost, last, fall, followed, 45, boost, start, 2015, Both, companies, able, raise, payouts, thanks, abilities, capture, growing, global, demand, oil, 
A, big, reason, oil, supplies, started, pile, mid, 2014, weaker, expected, oil, demand, growth, The, cure, low, oil, demand, often, low, oil, prices, certainly, appears, case, In, fact, IEA, recently, revised, oil, demand, growth, forecast, upward, expects, oil, demand, grow, 1, 3, million, barrels, per, day, It, sees, growth, rate, next, global, oil, demand, expected, average, 97, 4, million, barrels, per, day, 2017, 
Despite, global, push, renewables, combat, climate, change, expectation, demand, oil, continue, grow, well, future, driven, largely, emerging, market, economies, According, ExxonMobil, recent, outlook, energy, sees, demand, oil, growing, 0, 7, per, 2040, While, much, slower, pace, expected, 4, 8, annual, growth, rate, renewables, aggregate, demand, growth, oil, expected, much, higher, renewables, absolute, basis, 
This, growth, suggests, plenty, opportunities, ExxonMobil, producers, Energy, Select, SPDR, ETF, expand, production, also, keeping, oil, field, services, companies, like, Halliburton, busy, Further, given, bulk, world, future, oil, supplies, likely, come, complex, sources, like, deepwater, horizontal, drilling, require, higher, intensity, oil, field, services, implies, robust, growth, opportunities, Halliburton, In, words, lots, growth, left, oil, market, 
The, oil, sector, clearly, hit, rough, patch, past, couple, likely, caused, investors, consider, completely, avoiding, oil, stocks, future, While, understandable, might, best, idea, three, really, smart, reasons, invest, oil, stocks, Not, investor, hedge, future, increases, oil, prices, collect, nice, income, stream, sector, decline, Instead, still, lot, growth, ahead,
