Jason, Hall, Ensco, Since, oil, downturn, began, 2014, oil, companies, shied, away, expensive, long, develop, offshore, projects, preferring, invest, quick, turnaround, shale, projects, require, far, less, initial, investment, even, profitable, per, barrel, basis, require, constant, drilling, maintain, production, levels, But, point, offshore, resources, going, play, vital, role, meeting, global, energy, needs, Offshore, projects, may, complex, take, longer, develop, also, cheap, sources, oil, gas, starts, flowing, 
And, Ensco, excellent, company, eventuality, It, completed, acquisition, Atwood, Oceanics, strengthening, fleet, finished, 2017, signed, 15, new, rigs, awarded, producers, full, twice, much, market, share, anyone, else, Ensco, also, strengthened, balance, sheet, recently, issuing, 1, billion, long, term, notes, pay, debt, due, first, half, 2020, adding, 300, million, balance, sheet, The, company, 1, 2, billion, cash, hand, 2, 8, billion, contracted, work, backlog, 
At, recent, prices, Ensco, trades, less, 25, book, value, compared, 1, time, book, historically, Offshore, investment, slowly, starting, improve, Ensco, huge, winning, investment, plays, 
Matt, DiLallo, Enbridge, Canadian, oil, pipeline, company, Enbridge, shed, nearly, quarter, value, past, hard, justify, While, company, report, 10, decline, distributable, cash, flow, DCF, per, share, 2017, absolute, number, surged, 50, Driving, difference, company, issued, boatload, new, stock, finance, expansion, initiatives, weighed, per, share, number, last,

With, Enbridge, share, price, sliding, past, investors, buy, oil, pipeline, giant, growing, income, stream, dirt, cheap, price, 9, 5, times, DCF, For, comparison, sake, average, pipeline, stock, trades, closer, 12, times, DCF, As, company, per, share, DCF, starts, heading, higher, help, narrow, gap, Add, upside, company, high, yield, dividend, Enbridge, potential, deliver, compelling, total, return, coming, making, great, oil, stock, consider, buying, 
Reuben, Gregg, Brewer, ExxonMobil, Corporation, Giant, integrated, oil, companies, heading, higher, past, one, exception, ExxonMobil, Exxon, stock, fallen, nearly, 10, peers, including, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, Total, S, A, seen, stock, advances, low, teens, Is, something, wrong, Exxon, 
Exxon, falling, short, relative, integrated, peers, right, several, key, metrics, including, production, growth, return, capital, employed, Investors, voting, feet, buying, stock, oil, companies, performing, better, fundamental, basis, right, 
But, Exxon, laggard, showing, function, corporate, culture, errs, side, caution, long, term, thinking, company, worth, owning, It, number, growth, projects, works, including, expanding, position, onshore, U, S, oil, gas, tapping, new, assets, offshore, Guyana, Brazil, Mozambique, It, also, looking, improve, return, invested, capital, 2017, 7, 10, next, couple,
