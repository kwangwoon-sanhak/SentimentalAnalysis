Every, day, Wall, Street, analysts, upgrade, stocks, downgrade, others, initiate, coverage, But, analysts, even, know, talking, Today, taking, one, high, profile, Wall, Street, pick, putting, microscope, 
Strong, free, cash, flow, oil, company, phrases, often, find, together, sentence, In, past, I, cited, weak, free, cash, flow, relative, reported, net, income, GAAP, No, 1, reason, I, refuse, invest, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, despite, fact, Exxon, one, recognized, names, world, 
And, yet, funny, thing, happening, market, oil, stocks, past, week, All, sudden, Wall, Street, analysts, talking, free, cash, flow, reason, buy, oil, stocks, In, fact, seem, shut, Over, past, days, I, seen, free, cash, flow, mentioned, prominently, analyses, Wall, Street, bankers, fewer, three, separate, oil, stocks, ExxonMobil, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, 
Here, need, know, 
ARE, OIL, COMPANIES, FINALLY, PUMPING, CASH, WALL, STREET, SEEMS, TO, THINK, SO, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
ExxonMobil, example, horrible, free, cash, flow, producer, shining, star, either, Over, past, five, Exxon, generated, combined, 47, 6, billion, free, cash, flow, cash, operations, minus, capital, spending, according, data, S, P, Global, Market, Intelligence, Unfortunately, less, half, 108, 8, billion, net, income, company, says, earned, GAAP, accounting, standards, 
Commenting, company, prospects, last, week, analysts, Mizuho, Securities, declined, endorse, ExxonMobil, stock, note, covered, StreetInsider, com, requires, subscription, free, cash, flow, played, part, reasoning, Exxon, forced, take, steps, correct, Tillerson, era, missteps, says, Mizuho, require, Exxon, spend, heavily, chase, Permian, volume, growth, accelerate, Asian, LNG, push, rapid, Guyana, offshore, megaproject, development, continue, standing, still, next, 
As, result, Mizuho, think, Exxon, show, much, production, growth, 2020, earliest, At, time, Exxon, free, cash, flow, siphoned, away, pay, capital, investments, really, formula, investing, success, 
In, contrast, Exxon, Mizuho, says, preference, within, mega, cap, energy, Chevron, better, growth, free, cash, flow, dynamics, 2020, According, Mizuho, Chevron, stock, sells, 126, share, today, could, go, 145, within, delivering, investors, 15, profit, addition, paying, 3, 5, dividend, nearly, good, Exxon, 3, 9, 
But, even, Chevron, may, best, deal, big, oil, investors, love, free, cash, flow, Over, past, days, fewer, three, separate, analysts, highlighted, ConocoPhillips, strong, free, cash, flow, 
The, first, Mizuho, praising, Conoco, visible, free, cash, flow, low, sustaining, capex, No, sooner, Mizuho, pointed, though, Bernstein, chimed, saying, underestimated, investor, demand, strong, FCF, growth, story, predicting, Conoco, stock, would, gain, 17, next, rising, 82, share, 1, 6, dividend, yield, Now, today, BMO, Capital, Markets, joining, chorus, 78, price, target, outperform, rating, Conoco, stock, 
ConocoPhillips, boasts, robust, FCF, profile, competitive, near, term, production, growth, says, BMO, And, analyst, agrees, Bernstein, investors, attributing, increased, importance, FCF, yield, valuing, oil, companies, like, Conoco, Chevron, Exxon, Looking, 10, BMO, argues, Conoco, enjoy, low, single, digit, production, growth, annually, even, needs, spend, capital, investment, period, able, sustain, FCF, cycle, 
Investors, may, surprised, hear, Conoco, spoken, highly, Wall, Street, After, three, big, oil, companies, discussed, far, Conoco, one, currently, reporting, GAAP, profits, income, statement, And, yet, Mizuho, Bernstein, BMO, right, Conoco, generating, decent, free, cash, flow, 2, 5, billion, last, last, 12, according, S, P, Global, figures, welcome, turnaround, 2014, 2016, period, Conoco, burned, cash, 
That, said, Conoco, generating, stronger, free, cash, flow, income, statement, would, suggest, necessarily, mean, analysts, right, recommend, stock, With, market, capitalization, excess, 81, 2, billion, Conoco, stock, still, sells, hefty, 32, 5, times, trailing, free, cash, flow, long, term, growth, estimates, company, hover, around, 6, 
Fact, valued, free, cash, flow, even, Chevron, 27, 8, times, free, cash, flow, Exxon, 24, 4, times, FCF, sell, cheaper, multiples, FCF, Conoco, pay, bigger, dividends, Chevron, Exxon, may, cheap, still, cheaper, Conoco, stock, 
So, I, applaud, Wall, Street, decision, finally, start, paying, attention, free, cash, flow, oil, industry, I, fear, analysts, drawn, wrong, conclusions, seeing, None, three, companies, cheap, enough, buy, Conoco, included,
