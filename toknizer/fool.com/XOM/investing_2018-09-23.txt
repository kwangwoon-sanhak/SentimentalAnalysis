In, raw, processed, form, oil, natural, gas, referred, petroleum, Latin, rock, oil, Once, oil, extracted, ground, distilled, various, petroleum, products, gasoline, diesel, fuel, kerosene, petrochemicals, 
Although, oil, products, use, thousands, use, oil, skyrocketed, following, invention, internal, combustion, engine, mid, 1800s, Industrial, combustion, engines, generate, energy, igniting, fuel, combustion, chamber, move, pistons, blades, create, power, become, used, commonly, cars, trains, planes, machinery, ships, well, generate, electricity, worldwide, 
Oil, accounts, 90, fuel, vehicles, use, broadly, petroleum, represents, 40, total, energy, consumption, Because, oil, refined, chemical, reagents, also, feedstock, production, plastics, solvents, fertilizers, chemical, products, 
According, International, Energy, Agency, United, States, surpassed, Saudi, Arabia, become, second, largest, oil, producer, behind, Russia, 2017, United, States, overtake, Russia, become, world, largest, producer, soon, 2019, 
In, 2017, U, S, oil, production, exceeded, 10, million, barrels, per, day, bpd, first, time, since, 1970s, according, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, U, S, production, could, top, 11, million, bpd, later, If, could, neck, neck, Russia, reportedly, producing, 11, 06, million, bpd, June, 2018, 
The, increase, U, S, oil, production, due, technological, advancements, eased, extraction, oil, tough, access, formations, Specifically, use, fracking, forces, open, existing, fissures, extract, oil, using, high, pressure, injections, liquid, made, accessing, oil, shale, formations, Permian, Basin, less, expensive, turn, unleashed, flurry, drilling, activity, among, oil, gas, producers, 
Supply, demand, dictate, prices, commodities, oil, Regulation, legislation, increase, decrease, supply, depending, circumstances, large, oil, producing, countries, purposely, crimp, expand, supply, support, higher, lower, prices, 
For, instance, Organization, Petroleum, Exporting, Countries, OPEC, permanent, intergovernmental, organization, oil, producers, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi, Arabia, Venezuela, created, 1960, coordinate, oil, supply, maintain, price, objectives, Today, OPEC, 15, member, countries, produce, 40, world, crude, oil, OPEC, oil, exports, account, roughly, 60, total, petroleum, market, 
OPEC, decisions, maintain, oil, supply, existing, levels, U, S, shale, production, grew, contributed, significant, decline, west, Texas, crude, oil, Brent, crude, oil, prices, 2014, 2016, The, price, decline, continued, shale, production, became, unprofitable, resulting, slowdown, shale, output, OPEC, coordination, Russia, agreed, cut, oil, production, 1, 8, million, bpd, late, 2016, Since, OPEC, decision, restrict, supply, oil, prices, increased, significantly,
