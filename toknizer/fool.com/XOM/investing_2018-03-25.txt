At, moment, world, enough, oil, meet, needs, In, fact, much, OPEC, holding, back, production, drain, portion, excess, crude, sitting, storage, depots, around, world, Furthermore, according, estimate, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, oil, market, remain, well, supplied, least, 2020, even, though, demand, continue, expanding, brisk, pace, 
It, different, story, post, 2020, growing, concern, oil, industry, might, able, keep, continued, demand, growth, reinvesting, enough, money, longer, term, projects, That, could, result, big, shortfall, supplies, potentially, fueling, significant, spike, oil, prices, coming, 
In, latest, market, report, IEA, pointed, oil, industry, discovered, 4, billion, barrels, new, oil, resources, last, While, might, sound, like, plenty, fell, well, short, 36, billion, barrels, consumed, global, economy, last, It, also, record, low, industry, followed, similarly, poor, showing, 2016, industry, found, fewest, barrels, 70, Driving, dearth, discoveries, fact, oil, producers, significantly, cut, exploration, spending, recent, 
ANALYSTS, ARE, CRUNCHING, THE, NUMBERS, AND, DON, T, LIKE, WHAT, THEY, SEE, AHEAD, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
While, low, oil, prices, played, major, role, discovery, drop, string, drilling, expensive, dry, holes, caused, several, explorers, abandon, efforts, recent, One, notable, failures, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, big, flop, Arctic, waters, Alaska, The, big, oil, giant, spent, upwards, 7, billion, acquire, leases, drill, exploration, well, come, dry, U, S, oil, giant, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, also, big, ambitions, Alaskan, Arctic, never, got, ground, Those, failed, exploration, efforts, among, many, ConocoPhillips, recent, also, drilled, string, dry, holes, across, Atlantic, The, company, decided, abandon, deepwater, exploration, efforts, ago, 
The, decline, discoveries, recent, could, hurt, industry, road, However, pressing, issue, oil, companies, spent, less, money, developing, previous, finds, meet, medium, term, global, needs, The, IEA, noted, investment, spending, barely, budged, last, 6, higher, That, level, remains, well, peak, oil, prices, plunged, ago, concern, producers, spending, much, long, term, projects, boost, supplies, 2020, That, leading, IEA, warn, market, might, struggle, meet, growing, demand, future, 
While, steep, decline, price, oil, driven, spending, reduction, another, issue, oil, companies, allocated, capital, Instead, spending, money, major, long, term, projects, companies, like, ConocoPhillips, shifted, bulk, investments, drilling, shale, wells, U, S, unleash, quick, gusher, oil, need, continually, replace, new, wells, While, exceptional, returns, wells, enable, companies, produce, oil, less, money, maintain, strategy, forever, rapidly, depleting, inventory, prolific, shale, locations, leads, IEA, believe, output, resource, probably, peak, within, The, industry, therefore, needs, invest, longer, term, projects, developing, deepwater, discoveries, new, oil, sands, facilities, assets, deliver, steadier, production, rate, 
The, issue, handful, oil, giants, currently, pursuing, long, term, projects, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Hess, NYSE, HES, example, sanctioned, first, phase, offshore, discovery, Guyana, last, The, 3, 2, billion, project, produce, 120, 000, barrels, per, day, comes, online, 2020, Exxon, Hess, two, phases, development, could, ultimately, produce, 500, 000, barrels, per, day, That, development, part, ExxonMobil, big, push, add, 1, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, new, production, 2025, While, help, drop, bucket, industry, need, produce, 100, million, barrels, day, coming, 
Meanwhile, projects, take, much, longer, develop, For, example, Canadian, oil, giant, Suncor, Energy, NYSE, SU, recently, applied, build, new, oil, sands, facility, country, The, 160, 000, barrel, per, day, Lewis, project, would, cost, CA, 6, 2, billion, 4, 7, billion, However, Suncor, Energy, probably, even, break, ground, construction, 2024, produce, drop, oil, 2027, That, long, lead, time, large, scale, projects, one, reasons, IEA, remains, concerned, whether, industry, provide, enough, crude, meet, demand, early, part, next, decade, shale, output, begins, tapering, anticipated, 
While, world, remains, awash, oil, right, might, case, If, oil, demand, grows, much, anticipated, might, enough, fuel, shale, growth, tank, offset, decline, legacy, wells, meet, growing, need, crude, Oil, companies, therefore, must, start, work, longer, term, projects, come, online, around, time, shale, could, run, gas, If, wait, long, world, could, find, short, fuel, needs, could, potentially, cause, another, super, spike, crude, prices, That, investors, eye, toward, future, watch, industry, investment, levels, could, significant, future, ramifications,
