The, energy, industry, start, 2020, strong, footing, And, thanks, coronavirus, things, got, materially, worse, The, bad, fact, likely, mark, major, shift, direction, integrated, oil, majors, like, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, B, BP, NYSE, BP, Total, NYSE, TOT, even, U, S, oil, stalwarts, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Here, look, trends, need, thinking, 
After, decade, production, increases, U, S, onshore, space, growing, use, fracking, world, entered, 2020, slightly, production, demand, It, imbalance, OPEC, partners, trying, manage, production, cuts, The, problem, every, time, OPEC, trimmed, output, seemed, like, U, S, drilling, stepped, take, slack, Eventually, tensions, within, oil, group, started, rise, rift, opened, partner, Russia, 
Russia, OPEC, opened, spigots, started, pumping, oil, without, concern, demand, early, 2020, Oil, prices, started, fall, would, expect, At, time, going, however, coronavirus, starting, spread, around, world, alarming, rate, Countries, began, shut, economies, slow, spread, novel, illness, leading, steep, drop, energy, demand, With, supply, high, demand, falling, cliff, oil, prices, started, plunge, In, fact, price, West, Texas, Intermediate, crude, key, U, S, oil, benchmark, actually, fell, zero, one, point, 
OPEC, Russia, resolved, differences, pretty, quickly, damage, done, Worse, excess, oil, produced, getting, put, storage, That, led, overhang, supply, needs, worked, energy, prices, mount, sustained, rally, The, market, still, severely, balance, December, 2020, drawn, close, This, backdrop, enough, send, shares, energy, industry, giants, integrated, oil, majors, tailspin, But, part, story, 
At, time, supply, demand, hit, long, uptrend, U, S, production, growth, coronavirus, demand, issues, also, long, running, shift, toward, clean, energy, consider, From, renewable, power, electrification, auto, sector, energy, companies, Europe, started, believe, seismic, shift, taking, place, Some, viewed, coronavirus, demand, decline, warning, future, could, hold, energy, companies, act, haste, adjust, 
Both, Royal, Dutch, Shell, BP, straining, weight, low, oil, prices, announced, dividend, cuts, preserve, cash, At, roughly, time, revealed, plans, shift, capital, spending, priorities, placing, materially, greater, emphasis, transitioning, toward, clean, energy, solar, wind, power, electricity, based, businesses, like, electric, vehicle, charging, stations, Although, exactly, new, trend, announcements, pair, represented, material, increase, pace, change, BP, example, plans, cut, oil, natural, gas, production, massive, 40, 2030, In, short, 2020, mark, major, turning, point, businesses, use, cash, cow, energy, operations, fund, electric, clean, energy, overhaul, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Taking, less, extreme, position, Total, believes, sustain, dividend, long, oil, stays, 40, per, barrel, fund, slow, steady, shift, toward, electricity, The, French, energy, giant, planning, increase, production, natural, gas, expected, see, demand, growth, world, tries, reduce, carbon, emissions, It, reduce, oil, production, focusing, best, assets, And, continue, expand, exposure, electrons, tripling, size, business, 2030, The, key, however, planning, abandon, dividend, oil, sector, changes, To, use, sports, analogy, Total, choosing, punt, 
Chevron, Exxon, meanwhile, largely, decided, stay, course, carbon, front, Like, energy, majors, forced, reduce, spending, face, difficult, market, But, neither, announced, major, plans, transition, electricity, That, said, pressure, mounting, shift, activist, investors, Catholic, Church, pension, funds, Wall, Street, firms, looking, change, 
Although, U, S, giants, announced, changes, large, made, Europe, talking, cleaning, carbon, footprints, But, far, included, building, non, oil, operations, This, pair, relatively, speaking, doubling, fossil, fuels, 
There, obviously, way, know, future, holds, 2020, likely, represent, key, turning, point, oil, majors, start, transition, toward, clean, energy, 
For, oil, natural, gas, investors, question, consider, path, want, follow, BP, Shell, announced, material, directional, shifts, Total, cutting, middle, ground, And, Chevron, Exxon, taking, time, transition, believing, oil, market, still, life, left, Although, none, companies, appears, risk, becoming, obsolete, right, moving, slowly, could, end, left, behind, On, hand, moving, quickly, could, come, costs, oil, natural, gas, prices, surge, world, moves, past, coronavirus, 
There, easy, choices, investors, least, directional, choices, made, oil, companies, becoming, clear, As, investor, need, decide, option, makes, sense,
