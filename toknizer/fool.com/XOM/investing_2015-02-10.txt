ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, management, team, treats, conference, calls, like, Bill, Belichick, press, conference, following, end, game, Trying, get, executives, opinion, oil, market, heading, plan, oil, cheap, like, trying, get, blood, stone, But, ExxonMobil, management, tight, lipped, mean, calls, offer, valuable, nuggets, information, Here, four, things, Exxonmobil, recent, conference, call, management, thinks, anyone, invests, company, know, 
We, bothered, predicting, oil, prices, 
Many, us, try, invest, oil, gas, companies, based, crude, oil, prices, headed, But, approach, extremely, shortsighted, looking, company, ExxonMobil, needs, make, decisions, exploration, production, might, take, decades, even, develop, To, according, Vice, President, Investor, Relations, Jeff, Woodbury, company, use, oil, prices, measuring, stick, 
A, I, said, previously, demand, assessment, annual, basis, really, underpins, business, strategies, investment, plans, So, look, forward, see, oil, demand, growing, 0, 8, per, That, underpinned, transportation, chemical, needs, In, gas, sector, see, gas, demand, growing, 1, 5, 1, 6, per, primarily, underpinned, power, generation, industrial, demands, Now, overall, demand, growth, largely, underpinned, non, OECD, growth, think, business, scope, business, lay, business, strategies, investment, plans, really, focused, long, term, expectation, around, energy, demand, 
Rather, getting, caught, trying, predict, oil, prices, head, next, couple, ExxonMobil, instead, looks, global, demand, long, time, horizons, makes, investment, decisions, accordingly, If, plan, investing, company, ExxonMobil, consider, time, horizon, well, 
ready, oil, really, cheap, 
ExxonMobil, produces, 2, million, barrels, per, day, oil, chump, change, compared, 90, million, barrels, produced, daily, worldwide, basis, Since, oil, supply, segmented, largest, producer, Saudi, Aramco, 10, market, share, Woodbury, said, company, must, prepare, oil, prices, anything, moment, 
First, regardless, business, cycle, organization, strong, culture, driving, cost, structure, Whether, self, help, operating, costs, capital, efficiency, project, execution, expect, lead, cost, curve, capturing, savings, especially, downturns, like, experiencing, today, 
Second, challenge, investments, ensure, creating, long, term, shareholder, value, cycle, remember, price, takers, We, assume, price, growth, future, really, focus, things, control, like, costs, liability, course, project, execution, 
This, hope, best, prepare, worst, method, capital, allocation, large, reason, ExxonMobil, produced, best, returns, capital, employed, among, peers, past, several, 
Keep, ship, steady, 
It, tempting, company, produces, commodity, shift, capital, spending, accommodate, lower, prices, commodity, Such, moves, boost, profitability, short, run, major, impact, road, since, first, projects, cut, nascent, stages, According, Woodbury, though, ExxonMobil, best, avoid, falling, trap, instead, tries, maintain, spending, markets, order, thrive, road, 
The, thing, I, would, really, point, distinguishes, us, said, many, times, invest, business, cycle, present, opportunities, able, lower, cost, structure, improve, overall, longer, term, returns, given, financial, capability, 
As, long, ExxonMobil, maintain, capital, discipline, times, feast, famine, capture, market, rebounds, much, better, many, peers, 
When, blood, water, 
One, clear, advantage, ExxonMobil, many, competitors, superb, balance, sheet, This, gives, company, flexibility, take, advantage, downward, swings, commodity, cycle, making, strategic, acquisitions, This, one, times, Woodbury, hinted, company, looking, opportunities, 
We, continue, disciplined, investment, approach, throughout, cycle, forgo, attractive, opportunities, We, significant, debt, capacity, maintain, financial, flexibility, assess, cash, funding, options, range, outcomes, take, balanced, approach, meet, obligations, 
With, AAA, credit, rating, debt, capital, ratio, less, 9, ExxonMobil, immense, amount, financial, flexibility, seek, opportunities, grow, reserves, production, This, could, prove, incredibly, useful, oil, prices, remain, low, companies, great, assets, shaky, balance, sheets, come, hat, hand, 
What, Fool, believes, 
If, company, ready, handle, long, downturn, price, oil, ExxonMobil, The, oil, giant, global, footprint, assets, every, aspect, oil, gas, game, well, balance, sheet, secure, Cheyenne, Mountain, nuclear, bunker, makes, great, investment, looking, build, long, term, wealth, even, management, come, say, explicitly,

What, Shares, integrated, oil, natural, gas, behemoth, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, moved, fractionally, higher, 0, 06, close, 91, 56, Monday, despite, receiving, rating, downgrade, research, firm, Argus, hold, buy, 
So, According, Michael, Burke, covering, analyst, Argus, ExxonMobil, vastly, outperformed, oil, natural, gas, sector, peers, past, This, largely, due, diversified, business, comprises, upstream, downstream, chemicals, operations, well, relatively, low, levels, debt, compared, equity, 
However, Burke, believes, outperformance, may, coming, close, holds, bleak, outlook, regarding, ExxonMobil, ability, grow, reserves, production, Burke, worries, ExxonMobil, may, reach, growth, via, acquisition, something, always, worked, Furthermore, Burke, cites, company, plan, reduce, share, repurchases, 1, billion, first, quarter, 2015, prior, average, 3, billion, per, quarter, reason, shareholder, sentiment, may, negatively, affected, 
Now, The, 64, 000, question, needs, asked, whether, Argus, downgrade, merit, In, others, words, better, buying, ExxonMobil, 
In, personal, opinion, I, see, much, fear, buying, shares, long, term, I, could, certainly, see, merit, waiting, drop, crude, prices, 
On, one, hand, telling, low, crude, oil, prices, could, go, Although, recent, commentary, OPEC, given, small, rally, oil, legs, oil, supply, United, States, still, remains, high, total, drill, rig, counts, really, fallen, substantial, amount, yet, We, probably, need, see, consolidation, among, small, medium, size, drillers, significant, shrinkage, rigs, among, large, players, safely, proclaim, bottom, oil, In, meantime, means, ExxonMobil, revenue, profits, take, hit, 
On, flip, side, ExxonMobil, smorgasbord, global, assets, fall, back, spite, currently, weak, oil, prices, It, could, temporarily, hard, time, boosting, production, OK, long, term, energy, forecasts, side, 
ENERGY, OUTLOOK, THROUGH, 2040, SOURCE, UNITED, NATIONS, AND, EXXONMOBIL, 
According, ExxonMobil, energy, outlook, 2040, energy, demand, projected, double, 1, 2, quadrillion, BTUs, next, 25, That, bodes, well, ExxonMobil, sitting, number, onshore, drilling, opportunities, U, S, handful, offshore, deepwater, finds, coast, Africa, 
In, sum, I, believe, possible, ExxonMobil, could, head, lower, short, term, would, qualms, holding, shares, nibbling, I, intention, selling, next, five,
