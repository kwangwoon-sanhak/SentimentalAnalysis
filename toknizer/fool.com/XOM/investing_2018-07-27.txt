Biraj, Borkhataria, RBC, Capital, Markets, Director, 
Hi, Thanks, taking, question, Neil, best, luck, new, role, Neil, thank, joining, call, So, first, question, Downstream, So, look, like, impacted, quite, heavily, unplanned, downtime, Hopefully, behind, could, talk, maintenance, plans, rest, 2018, whether, anything, significant, either, Chemicals, Refining, aware, And, I, got, follow, U, S, gas, 
Neil, Hansen, Vice, President, Investor, Relations, Secretary, 
Thank, Biraj, Good, morning, thank, joining, call, I, look, forward, interacting, talking, ExxonMobil, value, proposition, So, question, maintenance, one, thing, say, expect, maintenance, 2018, 2019, bit, heavier, normal, Within, would, expect, see, seasonality, bit, heavier, second, quarter, coming, little, bit, third, quarter, It, difficult, us, get, specific, mention, specific, activities, sites, say, given, IMO, 2020, change, maintenance, activity, plan, next, result, bit, heavier, activity, see, seasonality, Neil, I, know, wanted, add, anything, 
Neil, Chapman, Senior, Vice, President, 
I, say, I, think, I, mentioned, comments, low, point, terms, volume, second, quarter, anticipate, volumes, increasing, moderate, increase, still, heavy, turnaround, schedule, third, quarter, quite, large, second, quarter, 
Biraj, Borkhataria, RBC, Capital, Markets, Director, 
Great, helpful, So, follow, U, S, gas, comments, question, really, timing, You, talked, releasing, exposure, lower, value, business, gas, market, well, supplied, number, I, wondering, drove, decision, spend, less, Is, fact, bringing, things, portfolio, What, going, 
Neil, Chapman, Senior, Vice, President, 
This, extraction, depletion, business, know, wells, start, deplete, choices, whether, want, drill, gas, whether, want, drill, liquids, believe, strong, advantage, position, Permian, course, This, goes, back, Bass, acquisition, made, couple, ago, I, mentioned, many, times, since, seen, continuous, upside, liquids, opportunity, Permian, Basin, So, choices, make, priority, calls, prioritizing, liquids, production, gas, production, 
Now, progressing, developments, Permian, Basin, really, important, us, capital, efficient, way, typically, mean, drilling, lot, wells, drill, pad, drill, several, time, come, frack, start, evacuate, gas, What, results, result, steady, increase, volume, It, little, bit, lumpy, Some, quarters, get, big, increase, volumes, 
Of, course, 45, increase, second, quarter, versus, first, quarter, Permian, sometimes, less, going, see, What, seeing, first, half, start, focus, liquids, I, would, say, deemphasize, somewhat, I, must, say, somewhat, completely, gas, business, seen, lower, amount, gas, production, second, quarter, first, half, replaced, replaced, liquids, coming, period, 
Biraj, Borkhataria, RBC, Capital, Markets, Director,
