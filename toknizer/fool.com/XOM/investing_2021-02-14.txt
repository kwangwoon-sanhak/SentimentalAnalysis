Earlier, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, unveiled, new, business, unit, commercialize, low, carbon, technology, portfolio, Its, focus, finding, ways, leverage, existing, expertise, participate, energy, transition, lower, carbon, fuel, sources, 
While, notable, step, company, I, think, goes, far, enough, I, concerned, Exxon, fall, behind, big, oil, rivals, making, bolder, commitments, clean, act, 
Exxon, plans, invest, 3, billion, lower, emissions, energy, projects, 2025, The, initial, focus, carbon, capture, storage, CCS, projects, though, company, also, explore, lower, carbon, technologies, future, including, hydrogen, It, currently, global, leader, CCS, existing, facilities, U, S, Australia, Qatar, capture, 9, million, tonnes, carbon, dioxide, per, equivalent, planting, 150, million, trees, It, several, projects, consideration, could, capture, store, millions, additional, tonnes, carbon, dioxide, per, 
However, 3, billion, Exxon, spending, tiny, fraction, capital, project, budget, carbon, friendly, projects, For, comparison, sake, expects, invest, 16, billion, 19, billion, capital, exploration, projects, 20, billion, 25, billion, annually, 2025, The, bulk, investment, spending, go, toward, discovering, developing, new, oil, gas, projects, While, oil, giant, expects, investments, grow, earnings, two, fold, 2027, thanks, margin, improvements, assuming, oil, prices, cooperate, production, steadily, decline, legacy, fields, deplete, 
While, global, economy, continue, need, fossil, fuels, rapidly, pivoting, toward, cleaner, sources, That, leading, Exxon, rivals, make, bold, moves, lower, carbon, energy, For, example, BP, NYSE, BP, unveiled, ambitious, plan, transition, fossil, fuels, renewable, energy, BP, plans, shrink, oil, gas, business, 40, 2019, level, 2030, boosting, renewable, power, generation, capacity, 2, 5, gigawatts, GW, 50, GW, timeframe, Powering, BP, transition, steady, shift, investment, spending, aiming, expand, low, carbon, investment, level, 5, billion, per, 2030, reducing, amount, reinvests, legacy, fossil, fuels, business, 
BP, taking, multifaceted, approach, lower, carbon, future, investing, renewables, bioenergy, hydrogen, CCS, The, company, recently, made, big, splash, offshore, wind, market, winning, leases, build, 3, GW, capacity, U, K, Fellow, European, oil, giants, Equinor, NYSE, EQNR, Total, NYSE, TOT, also, betting, big, offshore, wind, Total, joined, BP, recently, winning, UK, lease, auction, build, 1, 5, GW, capacity, That, part, company, decision, ramp, renewable, power, generation, investing, wind, solar, hydro, projects, objective, get, 15, 20, revenue, renewable, power, sales, 2040, 
Meanwhile, Equinor, partnered, BP, build, 4, 4, GW, offshore, wind, capacity, U, S, By, 2026, Equinor, expects, produce, 4, GW, 6, GW, renewable, energy, 10, times, current, capacity, expanding, 12, GW, 16, GW, 2035, 
While, rivals, building, renewable, energy, generating, projects, Exxon, strategy, lower, existing, oil, gas, business, carbon, intensity, expanding, CCS, operations, That, allow, stay, course, continue, investing, legacy, fossil, fuel, business, 
However, two, potential, flaws, approach, First, adds, cost, fossil, fuel, production, company, needs, invest, additional, capital, CCS, projects, lower, emission, profile, That, concern, considering, cost, renewable, energy, rapidly, falling, If, lower, carbon, fuels, continue, decline, cost, could, become, cheaper, produce, cleaner, fuels, oil, adding, expense, capturing, storing, associated, carbon, 
The, issue, I, Exxon, approach, nature, oil, business, capital, intense, production, oil, wells, declines, well, depletes, That, Exxon, needs, routinely, plow, bulk, cash, flow, produced, oil, gas, business, back, maintaining, output, developing, new, projects, replace, legacy, reserves, dry, That, evident, projected, decline, production, 2025, big, drop, BP, expects, see, 2030, 
Contrast, renewable, energy, project, produce, relatively, steady, state, decade, As, result, assets, relatively, low, maintenance, capital, requirements, Energy, companies, thus, flexibility, reinvest, cash, flow, generated, assets, expanding, capacity, return, investors, via, share, repurchases, dividends, 
Exxon, trying, embrace, energy, transition, lowering, carbon, intensity, oil, production, However, approach, look, like, pay, dividends, long, term, since, adds, costs, already, capital, intense, business, On, hand, European, rivals, shifting, spending, oil, gas, emissions, free, renewables, added, benefit, producing, relatively, steady, state, decades, Exxon, could, fall, well, behind, rivals, coming, I, love, low, carbon, strategy,
