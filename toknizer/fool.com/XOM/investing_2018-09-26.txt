After, nearly, century, elevating, global, living, standards, oil, gas, companies, beginning, consider, negative, externalities, products, business, models, A, combination, regulatory, economic, social, pressures, forced, world, largest, oil, producers, consider, exit, strategy, even, takes, decades, play, While, making, multibillion, dollar, investments, reduce, carbon, emissions, create, cash, flow, positive, businesses, renewable, technologies, road, maps, vary, 
The, different, approaches, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, great, example, The, former, currently, going, strategy, unique, among, peers, one, looks, leverage, global, refining, logistics, infrastructure, bringing, next, generation, renewable, fuels, mainstream, The, latter, clean, energy, strategy, looks, similar, peers, focus, natural, gas, investments, today, slowly, building, renewable, energy, power, generation, electricity, distribution, businesses, 
As, far, investors, concerned, oil, stock, better, buy, comes, renewable, energy, strategy, 
Although, many, oil, majors, renewable, fuels, strategy, mid, 2000s, pretty, much, abandoned, idea, ago, focus, market, ready, technologies, But, ExxonMobil, In, 2009, energy, giant, announced, 600, million, pact, synthetic, biology, leader, Synthetic, Genomics, chase, one, elusive, technologies, biotech, low, cost, algae, fuels, chemicals, 
The, goal, genetically, engineer, certain, species, algae, efficiently, produce, oil, compounds, using, sunlight, carbon, dioxide, several, added, nutrients, After, grown, large, outdoor, facilities, biomass, would, harvested, processed, ExxonMobil, refinery, network, oil, contained, within, individual, algae, cell, distributed, global, logistics, network, 
Despite, early, hiccups, pair, wavered, commitment, paid, far, A, genetic, engineering, breakthrough, 2017, nearly, doubled, amount, oil, produced, partnership, algae, strain, without, significantly, slowing, growth, rate, That, allowed, ExxonMobil, announce, next, leg, ambitious, project, 
By, 2025, companies, want, demonstrate, technical, ability, produce, 10, 000, barrels, per, day, next, generation, algae, fuel, works, facility, annual, capacity, 130, million, gallons, While, technical, ability, thing, built, hitting, milestone, could, true, energy, breakthrough, 
That, technology, hits, similar, targets, past, outdoor, algae, projects, might, efficient, enough, produce, three, times, much, oil, Permian, Basin, half, footprint, In, words, ExxonMobil, could, produce, America, fuel, requirements, 40, 000, square, miles, production, facilities, It, worth, shot, anyway,

Royal, Dutch, Shell, one, big, energy, producers, abandoned, ambitious, moonshot, approach, renewable, fuels, idea, turn, source, biomass, drop, renewable, fuels, chemicals, Today, focusing, building, portfolio, cash, flow, contributing, businesses, electric, gas, utility, infrastructure, wind, power, solar, power, energy, storage, 
Earlier, Dutch, oil, major, acquired, 44, stake, American, solar, developer, Silicon, Ranch, 880, megawatts, active, projects, least, another, 1, 000, megawatts, order, backlog, It, part, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plan, invest, 2, billion, calls, new, energies, three, period, ending, 2020, While, 7, 8, total, capital, investment, help, build, solid, foundation, renewable, energy, 
For, instance, equity, stake, Silicon, Ranch, provides, option, integrate, solar, energy, budding, electric, utility, business, Last, Royal, Dutch, Shell, acquired, U, K, based, electric, utility, First, Utility, well, U, S, based, MP2, Energy, The, latter, owns, natural, gas, distribution, network, provides, services, distributed, solar, 
The, strategy, build, electric, utility, power, generation, business, mirrors, peer, Total, maybe, dash, Equinor, investors, include, offshore, wind, strategy, It, also, obvious, hedge, future, climate, regulations, emerging, transportation, technologies, electric, vehicles, After, Royal, Dutch, Shell, becomes, major, global, electric, utility, still, shot, retaining, business, fueling, transportation, watts, instead, liquid, hydrocarbons, 
Of, course, ExxonMobil, Royal, Dutch, continue, almost, completely, dependent, oil, especially, gas, next, decade, two, Neither, expects, generate, significant, portion, business, renewables, near, future, But, also, one, biggest, differences, consider, 
That, ExxonMobil, knows, next, generation, renewable, fuels, outdoor, algae, cultivation, moonshot, expectation, project, contribute, business, anytime, soon, Royal, Dutch, Shell, however, demands, certain, rates, return, capital, investments, made, new, energies, For, instance, utility, businesses, acquired, 2017, profitable, today, 
That, huge, consideration, individual, investors, prioritize, building, wealth, role, playing, part, venture, capitalist, That, gives, Royal, Dutch, Shell, better, renewable, energy, strategy, hands, The, numbers, also, favor, Dutch, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, long, term, minded, investors,
