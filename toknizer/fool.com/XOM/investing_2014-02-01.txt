ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, fourth, quarter, financial, results, highlighted, oil, giant, continued, struggle, boosting, oil, gas, production, fell, 1, 8, earlier, quarter, Though, company, number, major, projects, slated, start, next, enough, deliver, 2, 3, annual, production, growth, company, targeting, 
Why, Exxon, production, fell, 
Despite, spending, record, 42, 5, billion, exploration, capital, projects, last, Exxon, fourth, quarter, upstream, earnings, declined, 13, 976, million, 6, 8, billion, companywide, earnings, fell, 16, 8, 4, billion, 1, 91, share, 10, billion, 2, 20, share, earlier, 
The, company, cited, lower, expected, output, operations, Canada, Kazakhstan, two, main, factors, behind, decline, oil, gas, production, Equipment, issues, prevented, company, Kearl, oil, sands, project, Canada, reaching, full, capacity, 110, 000, barrels, per, day, operations, Kazakhstan, delayed, pipeline, leak, 
These, issues, highlight, even, company, like, Exxon, known, superior, capital, allocation, peer, leading, capital, efficiency, expert, project, management, capabilities, immune, project, delays, And, given, company, plans, continue, spending, riskier, technically, complex, projects, around, world, next, five, delays, unexpected, interruptions, could, continue, weighing, production, 
Can, Exxon, boost, production, 
Still, Exxon, confident, boost, oil, gas, output, targeting, 2, 3, annual, production, growth, next, In, fourth, quarter, earnings, conference, call, management, touted, Kearl, oil, sands, project, whose, expansion, 70, complete, liquefied, natural, gas, project, Papua, New, Guinea, start, shortly, key, drivers, output, growth, 
Operations, U, S, company, plans, add, rigs, Texas, Permian, basin, continue, developing, fields, North, Dakota, Oklahoma, well, unconventional, opportunities, Argentina, Russia, Tanzania, also, expected, contribute, production, growth, But, despite, Exxon, optimism, reasons, skeptical, 
Firstly, company, lose, meaningful, amount, production, United, Arab, Emirates, estimated, approximately, 150, 000, barrels, per, day, annually, joint, venture, contract, drill, Abu, Dhabi, onshore, oilfields, ends, BP, NYSE, BP, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, Total, NYSE, TOT, also, hold, 9, 5, interest, company, developing, Abu, Dhabi, oilfields, also, equally, affected, 
Secondly, reduction, gas, production, Netherlands, Groningen, field, Western, Europe, largest, gas, field, due, concerns, gas, development, causing, tremors, also, weigh, Exxon, output, Exxon, operates, field, 50, 50, joint, venture, Shell, see, annual, production, Groningen, fall, 53, 8, billion, cubic, meters, bcm, last, around, 42, 5, bcm, next, 
Lastly, Exxon, recent, decision, sell, 25, stake, Iraq, West, Qurna, 1, field, PetroChina, NYSE, PTR, China, largest, oil, gas, producer, also, reduce, oil, production, Given, field, producing, many, 600, 000, barrels, oil, per, day, Exxon, net, production, cut, 360, 000, boe, 210, 000, boe, stake, field, falls, 60, 35, 
The, bottom, line, 
As, see, even, company, well, managed, Exxon, boosting, oil, gas, production, continuing, challenge, especially, given, execution, risk, associated, new, capital, intensive, technically, complex, projects, At, time, however, company, investments, long, lived, projects, Kearl, various, LNG, projects, throughout, world, help, reduce, decline, rates, provide, stable, base, production, 
Given, Exxon, consistency, generating, peer, leading, returns, invested, capital, extensive, investments, LNG, area, primed, rapid, growth, next, decade, I, think, Exxon, still, reasonably, attractive, company, hold, long, term, Furthermore, despite, sharp, rise, share, price, past, largely, Warren, Buffett, revelation, major, stake, company, shares, still, trading, roughly, 12, 4, times, forward, earnings, significantly, lower, long, run, average, 15, 6, times, period, 1995, 2013,
