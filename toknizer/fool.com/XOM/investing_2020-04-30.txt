Top, U, S, oil, companies, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, report, first, quarter, 2020, earnings, Friday, May, 1, Wall, Street, closely, watching, 
Obviously, lot, changed, since, first, quarter, ended, March, 31, We, seen, collapse, oil, prices, new, OPEC, deal, critical, shortages, oil, storage, infrastructure, With, mind, three, things, expect, ExxonMobil, Chevron, earnings, reports, 
When, fellow, oil, major, BP, NYSE, BP, reported, earnings, April, 28, worse, analysts, expected, thought, stock, market, would, punish, company, shares, Instead, BP, stock, finished, day, 4, 4, That, despite, record, 4, 4, billion, net, loss, quarter, news, BP, added, 6, billion, already, substantial, debt, load, 
Wall, Street, reaction, makes, sense, though, Oil, prices, change, real, time, everyone, see, current, record, low, crude, oil, prices, factored, companies, share, prices, long, report, earnings, Similarly, spreads, refined, products, also, measured, real, time, company, likely, refinery, margins, also, factored, stock, advance, 
That, means, normal, quarterly, report, data, likely, affect, oil, major, stock, price, production, numbers, refinery, throughput, operational, financial, news, would, impact, company, moving, forward, big, oil, discovery, example, refinery, outage, one, time, impairment, earnings, 
But, Q1, 2020, results, tell, us, much, store, Exxon, Chevron, The, quarter, 75, complete, oil, prices, crashed, wake, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, oil, price, war, It, 85, complete, states, issued, stay, home, orders, beginning, California, March, 19, And, collapsing, demand, insufficient, oil, storage, space, uncertain, economic, situation, general, going, care, Exxon, makes, another, oil, discovery, shore, Guyana, 
Unless, either, company, reports, something, truly, earth, shattering, expect, market, shrug, 
Chevron, ExxonMobil, suspended, initial, 2020, guidance, wake, COVID, 19, crisis, The, ongoing, evolving, nature, pandemic, means, really, impossible, guess, economy, oil, prices, industry, general, much, less, end, 
Both, companies, already, announced, major, cuts, 2020, capital, budgets, On, March, 24, Chevron, said, would, cut, 2020, capital, spending, 20, 16, billion, also, suspend, share, repurchases, ExxonMobil, joined, cost, cutting, party, April, 7, announcing, 30, 2020, capital, spending, cut, 23, billion, along, projected, operating, expense, reductions, 15, 
With, spending, reductions, planned, operations, air, clear, time, frame, return, normalcy, expect, Chevron, Exxon, issue, kind, guidance, Instead, probably, see, something, similar, statement, BP, earnings, release, 
Looking, forward, remains, exceptional, level, uncertainty, regarding, near, term, outlook, prices, product, demand, particularly, many, economies, remain, lockdown, It, difficult, predict, current, supply, demand, imbalances, resolved, ultimate, impact, COVID, 19, 
The, cost, cutting, measures, taken, ExxonMobil, Chevron, intended, reassure, investors, would, continue, pay, dividends, despite, yields, soaring, record, highs, March, Those, yields, since, come, somewhat, ExxonMobil, currently, 7, 3, Chevron, 5, 1, 
It, would, unlikely, either, company, take, extreme, measures, protect, dividends, cut, later, Certainly, companies, balance, sheets, better, shape, BP, ExxonMobil, boasts, debt, EBITDA, ratio, 1, 1, Chevron, 0, 9, lower, better, Meanwhile, BP, 3, 4, cut, dividend, choosing, instead, open, new, 10, billion, revolving, credit, facility, issue, 7, billion, new, bonds, 
It, likely, ExxonMobil, Chevron, also, need, take, additional, debt, said, done, likelier, go, route, least, first, consider, cutting, payouts, 
Obviously, shareholders, analysts, going, ExxonMobil, Chevron, quarterly, results, fine, toothed, combs, looking, clues, companies, may, headed, Any, indications, though, likely, far, covered, caveats, like, current, situation, persists, depending, economic, conditions, 
Still, smart, energy, investors, least, glance, companies, quarterly, results, They, may, tell, us, much, time, around, always, chance, reveal, something, useful,
