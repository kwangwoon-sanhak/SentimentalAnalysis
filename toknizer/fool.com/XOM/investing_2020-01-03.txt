International, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, plans, spend, 35, billion, 2025, massive, capital, investment, program, The, goal, reverse, multiyear, decline, production, The, problem, oil, natural, gas, prices, low, right, finding, cash, spending, difficult, increasingly, includes, asset, sales, Here, Exxon, fund, investment, plans, investors, worried, moves, making, 
The, third, quarter, tough, one, oil, companies, general, Exxon, avoid, pain, Its, third, quarter, earnings, roughly, 50, The, upstream, operation, oil, natural, gas, drilling, hardest, hit, representing, roughly, two, thirds, overall, decline, The, main, culprit, lower, liquids, gas, realizations, fancy, way, saying, prices, commodities, fell, Unfortunately, downstream, operations, chemicals, refining, offset, earnings, falling, well, The, main, cause, weaker, margins, Simply, put, rough, quarter, 
There, positive, hidden, bad, news, Exxon, production, increased, 3, third, quarter, That, shows, capital, spending, plans, bearing, fruit, This, progress, however, enough, overcome, impact, volatile, energy, prices, Oil, gas, prices, better, worse, biggest, driving, force, Exxon, 
This, highlights, big, problem, energy, giant, facing, today, It, investing, heavily, increase, production, time, oil, prices, relatively, low, How, Exxon, come, cash, keep, spending, increasing, concern, Wall, Street, The, answer, easy, 
The, first, issue, needs, addressed, Exxon, really, much, choice, comes, investing, production, growth, For, several, production, decline, trend, allowed, linger, long, At, least, needs, work, keep, production, roughly, flat, An, oil, company, continually, produces, less, less, oil, sustainable, path, 
The, second, issue, pay, investment, plans, huge, The, obvious, choice, simply, take, additional, debt, Exxon, balance, sheet, strength, financial, debt, equity, ratio, roughly, 0, 15, times, Most, closet, peers, ratios, least, twice, level, Simplistically, speaking, Exxon, could, double, roughly, 26, billion, debt, still, toward, lower, end, peers, leverage, wise,

Before, say, 26, billion, even, cover, one, company, spending, plans, run, rate, 35, billion, Exxon, need, fund, spending, debt, It, using, cash, flow, pay, much, capital, program, For, example, third, quarter, oil, giant, generated, roughly, 9, billion, cash, flow, Around, 3, 7, billion, cash, went, toward, shareholder, distributions, another, 6, billion, spent, capital, projects, Those, numbers, still, square, since, cash, going, door, exceeded, cash, coming, Exxon, also, sold, 1, 9, billion, debt, 500, million, worth, assets, filled, void, cash, balance, actually, increased, sequentially, 
Assuming, needs, sell, around, 2, billion, worth, debt, quarter, keep, math, simple, roughly, 8, billion, additional, debt, Exxon, current, investment, program, lasts, 2025, five, spending, left, That, means, 40, billion, worth, debt, get, 2025, These, rough, estimates, intended, make, larger, point, clearly, lot, going, Still, would, double, current, debt, Exxon, However, even, would, still, leave, financial, debt, equity, ratios, around, levels, heavily, leveraged, peers, 
Only, Exxon, looking, use, leverage, fund, investment, plans, also, intends, sell, assets, The, original, goal, sell, around, 15, billion, assets, If, use, offset, debt, needs, simple, model, outlined, bring, debt, issuance, 25, billion, That, roughly, doubling, company, current, debt, load, would, leave, Exxon, toward, low, end, peers, metric, 
More, recently, though, Exxon, reportedly, upped, asset, sale, goal, 25, billion, This, would, mean, even, less, need, debt, likely, driven, investor, concerns, company, increasing, leverage, Exxon, conservative, financial, profile, one, stock, key, selling, points, taking, materially, debt, tough, sell, Wall, Street, But, big, question, Is, decision, sign, trouble, 
Clearly, Exxon, stating, needs, cash, help, offset, hit, spending, plans, That, great, situation, largely, driven, fact, oil, prices, relatively, weak, today, However, need, step, back, look, going, big, picture, perspective, As, management, explained, Exxon, selling, assets, willy, nilly, Every, single, sale, compared, opportunities, portfolio, including, ones, investing, today, yet, producing, 
Exxon, take, selling, plans, sell, valuable, compared, oil, company, upgrading, portfolio, selling, Backing, Exxon, continuing, find, new, oil, biggest, development, projects, increasing, size, opportunities, So, selling, older, fields, really, big, deal, may, first, seem, And, assets, come, line, combined, investments, company, making, downstream, operations, cash, available, put, toward, company, massive, spending, plans, Yes, tough, right, Exxon, looks, like, still, heading, good, direction, 
It, accurate, say, Exxon, riding, high, today, clearly, mix, good, bad, news, Right, bad, news, weighing, heavily, financial, results, investor, perceptions, But, big, picture, perspective, Exxon, remains, decent, financial, shape, problems, supporting, spending, plans, 
While, increase, asset, sales, could, viewed, sign, financial, strain, likely, mix, assuaging, investors, reflection, strength, investment, pipeline, Investors, read, deeply, issue, since, production, Exxon, big, projects, expected, start, adding, materially, results, 2020, Production, Guyana, example, started, December, 2019, production, onshore, U, S, fields, still, ramping, Assuming, leads, robust, production, growth, Exxon, remains, solid, path, 
The, energy, industry, decidedly, favor, today, even, though, world, still, needs, oil, natural, gas, creates, That, presents, opportunity, investors, contrarian, bent, But, buying, old, energy, stock, way, go, want, financially, strong, names, handle, little, near, term, adversity, Here, three, companies, big, dividend, yields, muddle, rough, patch, relative, ease, 
With, yield, roughly, 5, international, energy, major, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, one, largest, diversified, oil, gas, companies, world, Operations, span, drill, bit, upstream, gas, pump, downstream, help, provide, stability, company, results, time, since, low, oil, prices, result, reduced, costs, company, refining, chemicals, operations, Having, assets, spread, across, globe, meanwhile, allows, company, tap, economic, growth, around, world,
