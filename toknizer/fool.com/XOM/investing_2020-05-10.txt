As, one, largest, integrated, oil, gas, companies, world, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, response, low, oil, environment, provides, good, indicator, expect, industry, 
Where, ExxonMobil, one, largely, dependent, speed, effectiveness, global, economic, recovery, since, company, relies, growing, oil, gas, use, fund, new, projects, 
Unfortunately, lot, Exxon, prior, predictions, simply, relevant, today, oil, prices, Just, ago, Exxon, expected, earnings, potential, double, 2025, flat, real, price, constant, margin, environment, assumption, based, 2017, actual, earnings, 60, Brent, prices, adjusted, inflation, next, five,

This, rhetoric, nothing, new, familiar, Exxon, Compared, energy, majors, ExxonMobil, runs, strictly, oil, gas, portfolio, Instead, investing, renewables, like, wind, solar, Exxon, investments, biofuels, carbon, capture, storage, represent, core, belief, best, use, time, money, making, oil, gas, industry, environmentally, friendly, profitable, 
Exxon, unrelenting, focus, oil, gas, means, company, unlikely, even, moderately, diversify, portfolio, renewables, anytime, soon, 
Despite, bullish, long, term, thesis, Exxon, implementing, 30, reduction, capital, expenditures, 15, reduction, cash, operating, expenditures, original, planned, levels, That, 30, reduction, mostly, affect, company, Permian, investments, shorter, term, flexible, projects, depend, higher, oil, prices, breakeven, For, spending, left, Exxon, continue, invest, megaprojects, like, Liza, Phase, 1, part, larger, strategy, Guyana, produce, 750, 000, barrels, per, day, bpd, 2026, pushed, back, one, 2025,

Oil, companies, arguably, better, undersupplied, market, focuses, higher, prices, producing, much, possible, 
This, downturn, probably, raise, barriers, entry, oil, business, since, Wall, Street, generally, unwilling, back, companies, even, accept, high, interest, rate, loans, In, many, ways, silver, lining, Exxon, side, dark, difficult, time,
