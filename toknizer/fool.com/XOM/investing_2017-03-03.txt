When, said, done, Credit, Suisse, shouted, effect, Enough, We, give, We, upgrade, And, promptly, rerated, ExxonMobil, neutral, 83, price, target,

StreetInsider, com, outlined, key, points, Credit, Suisse, upgrade, yesterday, important, point, one, Credit, Suisse, thinks, ExxonMobil, right, optimistic, oil, market, Credit, Suisse, sees, Brent, crude, oil, currently, selling, 55, barrel, rising, high, 65, barrel, near, future, 
As, Credit, Suisse, explains, initially, warned, oil, correction, back, 2014, back, oil, selling, well, 100, barrel, Credit, Suisse, downgraded, ExxonMobil, response, later, oil, prices, plunged, 50, barrel, A, return, 65, barrel, oil, though, put, ExxonMobil, stock, back, trading, around, late, 2014, 
As, see, chart, implies, stock, price, roughly, 83, share, ExxonMobil, stock, 
BRENT, CRUDE, OIL, SPOT, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
That, history, would, seem, imply, least, But, Credit, Suisse, reasons, liking, ExxonMobil, stock, well, For, example, 83, target, price, ExxonMobil, stock, selling, bit, 83, share, today, Credit, Suisse, thinks, stock, fairly, priced, today, forward, price, earnings, ratio, 17, 2, 
CS, admits, Majors, demonstrably, cheaper, Exxon, calling, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, particularly, cheap, Royal, Dutch, Shell, sells, forward, P, E, 11, 2, But, analyst, also, believes, ExxonMobil, stock, look, bad, saying, earning, maintenance, level, free, cashflow, 
In, fact, according, data, S, P, Global, Market, Intelligence, Exxon, actually, producing, quite, respectable, 5, 9, billion, positive, free, cash, flow, today, That, half, much, company, generating, back, 2014, 12, 1, billion, But, compares, favorably, Royal, Dutch, Shell, spending, capex, therefore, already, burning, cash, today, cheap, oil, environment,
