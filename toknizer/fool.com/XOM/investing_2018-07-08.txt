ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, ramping, capital, spending, focus, finding, new, oil, natural, gas, drill, sell, Some, peers, meanwhile, begun, look, ways, diversify, away, carbon, based, fuels, That, seems, make, sense, given, negative, view, energy, sources, today, Exxon, doubling, oil, gas, Here, need, know, understand, integrated, oil, giant, plan, nearly, crazy, may, appear, 
Exxon, plans, spend, around, 24, billion, capital, projects, 2018, While, number, includes, investments, downstream, chemical, refining, businesses, largely, earmarked, oil, natural, gas, drilling, It, giant, projects, works, Guyana, Brazil, onshore, U, S, market, Mozambique, among, others, 
The, current, 24, billion, however, starting, point, Exxon, It, expects, increase, figure, around, 15, 2019, By, 2023, Exxon, capital, spending, run, rate, around, 30, billion, roughly, 25, projected, 2018, level, By, 2025, new, projects, expected, account, around, 50, Exxon, oil, natural, gas, production, everything, goes, according, plan, It, truly, doubling, oil, gas, 
Some, peers, meanwhile, looking, hedge, bets, France, Total, SA, NYSE, TOT, example, venturing, electricity, generation, It, started, purchasing, controlling, stake, U, S, based, renewable, power, company, SunPower, 2011, augmented, venture, recent, deal, acquire, French, Belgian, power, company, Direct, Energie, Total, alone, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, NYSE, RDS, B, recently, bought, stakes, solar, power, company, Silicon, Ranch, NewMotion, one, Europe, largest, electric, car, charging, companies, 
Exxon, traditionally, conservative, slow, moving, company, missing, big, picture, allowing, peers, get, head, start, Maybe, Exxon, sticking, oil, natural, gas, 
There, question, oil, natural, gas, vital, world, economic, development, They, remain, important, today, But, future, set, look, different, According, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, energy, industry, trade, group, The, future, electrifying, That, commentary, exciting, things, statement, increasing, importance, electricity, satisfying, world, thirst, energy, Electricity, projected, make, 40, rise, final, consumption, 2040, according, IEA, share, growth, oil, took, last, twenty, five, 
No, wonder, Total, Shell, starting, shift, electricity, space, But, story, meets, eye, Total, energy, demand, projected, expand, around, 30, 2040, driven, largely, emerging, markets, However, means, total, pie, getting, bigger, Yes, electricity, driven, renewable, sources, like, solar, wind, going, help, lead, way, mean, oil, natural, gas, ceding, roles, dominant, important, fuel, sources, 
For, example, despite, fact, oil, share, total, energy, demand, likely, decline, long, term, EIA, projects, oil, demand, continues, grow, 2040, albeit, steadily, decreasing, pace, That, dynamic, possible, total, energy, demand, increasing, Natural, gas, use, meanwhile, projected, increase, 45, continues, take, share, away, relatively, dirty, coal, becomes, potential, bridge, world, shift, toward, renewable, energy, 
So, Exxon, decision, stick, knows, best, oil, natural, gas, nearly, crazy, sounds, There, doomsday, scenario, unfolding, oil, natural, gas, But, whole, story, either, 
Oil, natural, gas, depleting, resources, Once, pull, energy, sources, ground, use, gone, need, find, oil, gas, replace, You, stop, spending, money, drilling, effectively, run, oil, natural, gas, How, shocking, number, According, EIA, 80, new, oil, supply, today, 2040, needed, offset, natural, declines, going, take, place, period, 
WITHOUT, MORE, SPENDING, THE, WORLD, WILL, QUICKLY, START, TO, RUN, OUT, OF, OIL, AND, NATURAL, GAS, IMAGE, SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, 
That, huge, Exxon, suggesting, much, 400, billion, worth, capital, spending, needed, 2040, meet, global, oil, demand, That, puts, vastly, different, light, Exxon, 30, billion, capital, spending, going, go, directly, toward, oil, While, 2040, still, two, decades, away, oil, natural, gas, important, today, 
While, Total, Shell, making, early, moves, adjust, future, electricity, global, fuel, choice, remain, long, way, wholesale, shift, away, oil, natural, gas, There, nothing, wrong, strategic, moves, making, look, big, picture, also, nothing, particularly, worrying, Exxon, decision, remain, focused, oil, natural, gas, Yes, Exxon, doubling, carbon, based, fuels, knows, best, fine,
