Global, oil, demand, expanded, relatively, steady, pace, decades, At, current, growth, rate, global, oil, consumption, hit, 100, million, barrel, per, day, BPD, mark, next, 97, 8, million, BPD, 2017, According, forecasts, including, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, demand, continue, climbing, least, 2040, even, accelerated, growth, electric, vehicles, 
However, new, estimate, energy, industry, consultancy, Wood, Mackenzie, pushed, time, frame, four, sees, 2036, oil, demand, peak, Driving, view, expected, accelerated, adoption, autonomous, electric, vehicles, predicts, become, widely, accepted, 2035, While, would, finally, curb, world, insatiable, demand, oil, dry, completely, 
Wood, Mackenzie, long, term, energy, outlook, sees, radical, shift, horizon, Autonomous, electric, vehicles, robo, taxis, really, change, face, transport, coming, decades, according, head, crude, oil, research, Ed, Rawl, In, Wood, Mackenzie, view, become, commercial, 2030, widely, accepted, 2035, These, vehicles, displace, disproportionate, amount, oil, based, transport, cause, oil, demand, stop, upward, climb, 
But, although, Wood, Mackenzie, expects, oil, demand, plateau, 2036, expect, demand, crude, dry, overnight, That, take, gas, guzzling, vehicles, road, developed, countries, even, longer, developing, nations, Add, fact, world, also, uses, oil, make, jet, fuel, key, building, block, plastics, likely, remain, important, global, economy, come, 
While, Wood, Mackenzie, view, suggests, oil, industry, face, major, disruption, road, investors, lose, sight, fact, world, need, significant, amount, oil, 2036, With, demand, expected, peak, 105, million, BPD, according, IEA, oil, companies, work, cut, They, first, need, drill, enough, new, wells, overcome, natural, decline, rate, legacy, fields, deplete, Wood, Mackenzie, expects, average, 5, per, least, 2020, even, meet, growing, demand, In, words, industry, need, invest, hundreds, billions, dollars, per, keep, market, needs, 
That, become, increasingly, difficult, coming, industry, slashed, investment, spending, large, long, term, projects, recent, downturn, In, IEA, view, industry, could, struggle, keep, The, agency, worried, supply, picture, 2020, projects, production, growth, U, S, shale, plays, start, slow, without, enough, long, term, projects, works, fill, gap, That, scenario, could, trigger, significant, spike, oil, prices, 
Some, big, oil, companies, already, beginning, ramp, spending, anticipation, market, need, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, unveiled, long, term, plan, earlier, The, oil, giant, expects, steadily, increase, spending, boosting, 23, 1, billion, last, 24, billion, 2018, hitting, 28, billion, next, way, average, 30, billion, annually, 2023, 2025, This, investment, enable, ExxonMobil, add, incremental, 1, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, D, output, 2025, boosting, around, 5, million, BOE, D, 
However, others, continue, hold, back, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, instance, expects, spend, 18, billion, 20, billion, per, new, oil, wells, even, though, oil, prices, upswing, range, slightly, lower, initial, outlook, would, spend, 17, billion, 22, billion, per, capital, projects, Chevron, revised, targets, wants, improve, investment, returns, generate, free, cash, flow, cover, dividend, opposed, pursuing, potential, growth, opportunities, come, way, since, might, ding, returns, Chevron, several, large, producers, lack, plans, ramp, spending, could, leave, industry, ill, prepared, meet, supply, challenges, appear, likely, coming, since, demand, continue, grow, almost, two, decades, 
The, rise, autonomous, electric, vehicles, could, finally, cure, get, world, addiction, oil, However, ascension, appears, horizon, likely, still, several, make, impact, Thus, oil, industry, seems, plenty, left, tank, could, enrich, investors, coming, especially, since, looking, increasingly, likely, could, endure, another, period, high, prices, distant, future,
