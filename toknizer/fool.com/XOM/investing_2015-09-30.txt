There, lot, terms, could, used, describe, energy, stocks, days, stable, certainly, one, Even, stalwarts, industry, integrated, majors, rough, go, lately, decline, oil, prices, turned, profits, gusher, trickle, Thanks, integrated, model, touches, every, part, oil, gas, value, chain, though, Big, Oil, players, able, handle, energy, downturn, much, better, others, 
Integrated, oil, gas, companies, long, lucrative, investment, Their, ability, weather, cyclical, nature, energy, market, pay, rather, generous, dividends, makes, great, place, invest, long, term, That, even, true, chance, buy, companies, low, points, industry, cycle, like, today, So, let, take, good, hard, look, biggest, names, oil, gas, industry, see, get, best, bang, buck, Big, Oil, stock, 
The, usual, subjects, 
The, integrated, oil, gas, business, model, pretty, prevalent, around, world, For, part, though, associate, term, Big, Oil, five, companies, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, BP, NYSE, BP, Total, NYSE, TOT, You, could, argue, couple, companies, added, Statoil, Petrobras, PetroChina, let, leave, since, straddle, line, publicly, traded, company, state, run, entities, 
To, determine, companies, best, investment, today, let, look, five, key, components, margins, free, cash, flow, production, potential, returns, valuation, 
Margins,

As, expected, big, decline, oil, prices, past, margins, companies, taken, slight, hit, It, interesting, note, though, companies, margins, held, better, others, throughout, decline, The, notable, ones, Total, Shell, ExxonMobil, In, case, Shell, higher, exposure, natural, gas, downstream, refining, others, help, keep, margins, steady, In, case, ExxonMobil, Total, two, companies, done, better, job, controlling, costs, production, brought, breakeven, costs, helped, maintain, level, profitability, upstream, operations, compared, others, 
Compared, last, Chevron, far, seen, largest, decline, margins, This, also, understandable, since, company, business, much, levered, upstream, production, others, 
One, great, challenges, Big, Oil, players, next, couple, ability, control, costs, development, new, resources, Much, new, production, sources, come, expensive, sources, oil, like, ultra, deepwater, fields, oil, sands, two, oil, sources, high, breakeven, cost, ranges,

Some, costs, oil, sources, come, big, spenders, push, cheaper, contracts, oil, services, companies, yet, see, realize, substantial, benefits, savings, 
Looking, numbers, looks, though, ExxonMobil, wins, margins, Chevron, Total, holding, well, keeping, earnings, near, 10, historical, averages, 
Free, cash, flow, 
SOURCE, S, P, CAPITAL, IQ, 
Talk, bad, timing, Over, past, couple, oil, prices, high, companies, midst, spending, big, bucks, mega, projects, Since, 2013, 2014, though, capital, budgets, Big, Oil, decline, looking, reap, sown, The, problem, oil, prices, since, plummeted, So, gains, cash, flows, companies, slated, receive, spending, declined, new, projects, came, online, almost, immediately, evaporated, weak, oil, prices, 
BRENT, CRUDE, OIL, SPOT, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
The, real, value, proposition, Big, Oil, companies, provide, shareholders, fact, generate, tons, excess, cash, capital, expenditures, pay, generous, dividends, buy, back, shares, boost, stock, prices, However, becoming, difficult, rate, projects, come, online, still, slower, rate, cash, flows, declined, To, meet, cash, shortfalls, seen, many, players, sell, several, billions, assets, 
Operational, cash, flow, percent, capital, expenditure, less, 100, means, cash, spent, generated,

It, appears, Royal, Dutch, Shell, ExxonMobil, done, best, job, past, 12, 18, keeping, cash, budgets, line, Even, ability, fund, capital, projects, cash, flow, thougfh, Royal, Dutch, Shell, aggressive, sellers, non, core, assets, A, large, part, asset, sales, revamp, portfolio, pending, BG, Group, merger, 
The, two, companies, look, trouble, Chevron, Total, neither, able, fund, spending, generated, cash, since, 2012, The, one, thing, gives, small, solace, low, cash, generation, numbers, two, aggressive, production, growth, targets, 
Production, 
Pretty, much, things, discussed, thus, far, reflection, past, company, future, hold, Yes, companies, integrated, oil, gas, companies, look, capital, spending, companies, exploration, production, spending, makes, vast, majority, spending, dollars, Because, imperative, keep, large, quiver, projects, times, well, grow, production, without, going, budget, 
It, hard, put, quantifiable, metrics, company, production, profile, many, variables, consider, So, instead, getting, deep, weeds, let, look, couple, things, First, much, plan, grow, production, relation, current, production, Second, kind, price, assumptions, made, giving, project, go, ahead, Finally, kind, shelf, life, projects, Certain, projects, short, lifespans, think, shale, wells, others, multi, decade, cash, generators, think, oil, sands, LNG, facilities, Here, quick, look, company, plan, next, three, five, 
BP, 
SOURCE, BP, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
For, past, BP, seemed, bit, like, rudderless, company, Extraneous, factors, litigation, surrounding, Gulf, Mexico, oil, spill, complicated, relationship, Russian, sanctions, owns, almost, 20, Russian, oil, giant, Rosneft, made, company, focus, immensely, considered, high, return, production, In, recent, production, guidance, however, looks, like, really, trying, make, lost, time, An, additional, 900, 000, barrels, per, day, would, boost, today, production, 40, close, 3, million, barrels, per, day, The, biggest, driving, factor, results, second, phase, development, Shah, Deniz, gas, field, This, 28, billion, project, deliver, close, 600, 000, barrels, oil, equivalent, mostly, natural, gas, Caspian, Sea, continental, Europe, 
The, one, note, caution, growth, plans, many, developments, given, green, light, assumption, 80, per, barrel, oil, price, projects, pipeline, beyond, 2020, currently, screened, using, 100, per, barrel, Brent, price, 
SOURCE, BP, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
A, couple, ago, decisions, made, sounded, pretty, conservative, Today, though, 80, per, barrel, dream, Management, said, stress, tested, many, projects, 60, per, barrel, price, environment, barely, breaking, even, 60, per, barrel, may, position, couple, There, many, people, think, oil, prices, remain, low, many, come, would, much, reassuring, BP, build, future, production, plans, much, conservative, price, assumption, 
Chevron, 
Because, several, various, factors, company, struggles, remain, within, cash, flow, lower, oil, prices, Chevron, projected, production, 3, 1, million, barrels, per, day, slight, decline, projecting, couple, ago, Still, addition, 500, 000, barrels, per, day, three, span, pretty, ambitious,

Like, BP, Shah, Deniz, project, Chevron, lot, stake, two, LNG, projects, Wheatstone, Gorgon, Combined, two, facilities, represent, 42, billion, capital, spending, Chevron, Once, running, assumption, company, able, wind, capital, spending, bring, cash, generation, versus, spending, issue, back, balance, 
Once, operational, company, decent, suite, projects, work, appear, massive, capital, development, needs, see, LNG, facilities,

The, one, note, may, issue, going, forward, company, 70, Brent, price, assumption, project, portfolio, It, much, conservative, estimate, BP, 80, per, barrel, projection, long, lull, oil, prices, 70, could, really, put, sting, Chevron, profitability, going, forward, 
ExxonMobil, 
In, comparison, many, company, growth, projections, ExxonMobil, looks, downright, modest, One, thing, remember, though, ExxonMobil, production, 4, million, barrels, per, day, much, much, larger, peers, So, simply, maintaining, base, going, daunting, challenge, Still, company, projecting, 2, 3, production, growth, 2017, Overall, ExxonMobil, plans, next, couple, make, company, liquids, production, larger, portion, portfolio, 
SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
What, makes, Exxon, production, growth, attractive, though, based, plan, conservative, price, assumption, peers, single, project, sticks, must, well, project, The, company, current, price, assumption, based, 55, per, barrel, Brent, oil, single, project, working, abnormally, sized, capital, obligation, compared, others, Even, ExxonMobil, conservative, price, assumption, company, still, wide, swath, potential, projects, choose, grow, future,

Royal, Dutch, Shell, 
Like, BP, ago, Shell, decided, forgo, making, future, growth, projections, based, production, Instead, company, projections, generate, free, cash, flow, company, Over, next, five, suite, 10, major, projects, constitute, biggest, capital, obligations, mostly, related, either, LNG, deepwater, production, 
SOURCE, ROYAL, DUTCH, SHELL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
When, also, add, BG, Group, Shell, portfolio, becomes, even, clear, Shell, banking, heavily, LNG, deepwater, Once, combined, Shell, BG, Group, LNG, production, double, largest, competitor, Also, combined, company, large, presence, Brazil, prolific, pre, salt, offshore, fields, Once, current, developments, brought, line, represent, close, 600, 000, barrels, per, day, production, Shell, 
Beyond, current, portfolio, development, picture, Shell, becomes, little, less, clear, One, issue, Shell, expects, unload, 35, billion, assets, part, BG, merger, decided, go, froward, several, major, development, projects, past, couple, 
SOURCE, ROYAL, DUTCH, SHELL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
The, thing, makes, Shell, development, plans, unsure, many, projections, done, 70, per, barrel, Brent, price, Again, worst, assumption, make, future, exactly, conservative, one, either, 
Total, 
This, time, last, Total, arguably, ambitious, growth, plan, Not, largest, per, barrel, increase, largest, compared, current, production, rates, Earlier, last, week, though, company, announced, slightly, cutting, 2017, growth, projections, order, conserve, capital, maintain, dividend, payments, This, new, projection, cut, current, growth, run, rate, 2, 8, million, barrels, per, day, 2, 6, million, barrels, per, day, still, represents, pretty, healthy, growth, production, level, 2, 1, million, barrels, per, day, fiscal, 2014, 
SOURCE, TOTAL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
Another, component, makes, Total, intriguing, company, terms, future, production, setting, conservative, price, assumptions, Under, current, plan, announced, September, 23, CEO, Patrick, Pouyanne, said, current, production, plan, based, enough, free, cash, flow, cover, dividend, selling, price, 60, per, barrel, Brent, Furthermore, said, current, prices, improve, much, coming, use, 45, per, barrel, cash, flow, breakeven, price, investment, plans, 2019, At, price, levels, company, still, believes, plenty, targetable, projects, 
SOURCE, TOTAL, INVESTOR, PRESENTATION, 
Of, production, plans, laid, Total, seems, real, winner, Its, combination, strong, production, growth, conservative, price, assumptions, gives, attractive, profitable, growth, This, may, bias, showing, I, taking, ExxonMobil, next, best, I, attracted, conservative, assumption, price, going, forward, production, growth, portfolio, 
I, still, think, Chevron, growth, program, looks, attractive, provided, finish, Gorgon, Wheatstone, budget, rest, way, higher, price, assumption, slightly, unnerving, Shell, gets, incomplete, know, company, look, like, post, BG, merger, BP, price, assumptions, future, high, comfortable, Prices, could, absolutely, go, back, 100, range, five, 10, I, would, prefer, company, plan, future, 
Generating, returns, shareholders, 
Production, growth, good, done, way, generates, return, company, long, term, Price, assumptions, production, targets, help, guide, decision, allocate, capital, actually, executing, plan, generating, return, keeping, projects, operational, expenses, budget, The, best, way, us, measure, look, returns, For, use, returns, equity, management, rates, return, 
The, easy, way, looking, return, equity, divide, earnings, continuing, operations, total, equity, company, However, looking, like, mask, things, like, companies, juicing, numbers, debt, So, let, use, known, DuPont, model, near, 100, old, model, breaks, return, equity, components, gives, us, better, overall, picture, This, graphic, helps, describe, components, 
By, multiplying, components, together, get, return, equity, Here, companies, compare, using, model,

Pretty, much, across, board, ExxonMobil, advantage, peers, It, better, margins, lower, interest, burden, lower, amount, debt, general, generally, efficiecnt, comes, paying, taxes, One, skew, numbers, ExxonMobil, favor, fact, retired, many, shares, past, repurchases, book, value, considerably, lower, market, value, You, see, prominently, look, company, Treasury, stock,

This, one, reasons, need, take, return, metrics, grain, salt, certain, balance, sheet, income, statement, anomalies, skew, So, double, check, let, look, management, rate, return, well, This, metric, total, earnigns, interest, tax, divided, value, propterty, plant, equipment, net, depreciation, plus, net, working, capital, This, generally, indication, well, management, allocates, capital, well, present, future, assets, generate, return, 
SOURCE, S, P, CAPITAL, IQ, 
As, see, Total, really, closes, gap, ExxonMobil, metric, high, margins, late, recent, slew, projects, come, line, boosting, returns, underlying, assets, company, Looking, I, think, still, give, ExxonMobil, top, spot, Total, pretty, close, second, since, generating, comparable, management, rate, returns, returns, equity, considering, ExxonMobil, unfair, advantage, metric, 
Valuation, 
So, far, looked, buying, need, ask, question, price, Buying, one, better, performing, companies, looks, like, good, idea, company, trades, huge, premium, may, worth, premium, Do, keep, mind, companies, traditionally, traded, big, discounts, broader, market, since, mature, grow, slowly, Here, stack, 
Current, valuation,

Compared, broader, market, every, one, companies, looks, like, screaming, buy, The, one, issue, valuing, cyclical, commodity, stocks, earnings, margins, swing, back, forth, based, oil, prices, little, harder, pin, whether, company, cheap, based, figures, Also, need, take, account, companies, large, asset, writedowns, impact, EPS, like, ones, Total, Shell, done, past, 12,

You, could, argue, though, much, better, way, measure, value, cyclical, companies, price, tangible, book, value, since, value, underlying, assets, company, change, much, Looking, metric, appears, Chevron, Shell, best, buys, since, trade, biggest, discount, historical, tangible, book, value, Shell, particular, trades, less, liquidation, value, underlying, assets, mostly, tied, pending, move, acquire, BG, Group, That, said, huge, difference, 
What, Fool, believes, 
Traditionally, investors, flocked, Big, Oil, companies, stable, dividend, payers, work, commodity, cycles, Based, share, prices, performed, past, might, question, still, holds, true, Personally, I, still, think, investment, thesis, integrated, oil, gas, companies, hold, The, development, emerging, markets, around, world, continue, drive, oil, gas, demand, many, come, even, inclusion, alternative, energy, sources, 
With, mind, looks, like, amazing, opportunity, buy, Big, Oil, companies, today, Their, recent, earnings, taken, hit, none, become, immensely, financially, strained, downturn, stock, valuations, across, Big, Oil, dirt, cheap, 
Based, data, presented, I, personally, inclined, say, Total, best, bunch, invest, today, Its, margins, held, best, downturn, gaining, ExxonMobil, best, returns, business, growth, portfolio, looks, extremely, robust, maintaining, rather, conservative, oil, price, projection, valuation, suggests, good, bang, buck, Its, spending, bit, issue, right, many, large, projects, slated, come, line, next, 12, help, close, gap, spending, generated, cash, flow, 
ExxonMobil, came, close, second, strong, margins, best, returns, robust, cash, flows, cover, spending, cash, flow, I, little, less, impressed, results, Chevron, late, I, still, holding, judgment, fully, I, see, Gorgon, Wheatstone, facilities, running, 2016, 2017, 
I, completely, sold, idea, near, bottom, oil, share, prices, companies, There, many, uncertain, aspects, oil, market, say, way, wind, blow, However, stock, prices, levels, great, buying, opportunity, companies, Even, prices, remain, levels, could, give, investors, long, window, accumulating, position, one, two, companies, could, reap, huge, rewards, several, road,
