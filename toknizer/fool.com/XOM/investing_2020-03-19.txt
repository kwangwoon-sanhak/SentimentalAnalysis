The, new, coronavirus, could, well, tip, world, recession, It, already, pushed, air, travel, major, slump, left, industrial, activity, mired, slowdown, With, already, oversupplied, market, oil, prices, plummeted, 30, level, It, hard, oil, companies, turn, profit, oil, 50, range, even, harder, Oil, companies, world, starting, pull, back, drilling, efforts, But, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, U, S, production, growth, destined, slow, Here, deeper, dive, issue, need, understand, subtleties, Exxon, onshore, business, jumping, conclusions, 
There, question, COVID, 19, disaster, energy, sector, And, likely, get, much, worse, gets, better, countries, around, world, telling, people, stay, home, demanding, travel, curtailed, general, economic, growth, grinding, halt, affected, regions, China, one, largest, economies, world, preview, could, happen, global, scale, And, even, giant, nation, recovery, enough, offset, hit, world, COVID, 19, spreads, rapidly, around, globe, 
Since, oil, cyclical, business, driven, economic, ups, downs, oil, prices, likely, see, continued, downward, pressure, COVID, 19, illness, better, contained, least, better, understood, And, time, going, OPEC, Russia, middle, price, war, Neither, wants, oil, low, today, agree, production, cuts, prop, price, The, real, issue, however, U, S, onshore, production, ramping, swiftly, recent, Every, time, OPEC, cuts, production, U, S, production, basically, picks, slack, And, every, time, oil, prices, rise, increased, U, S, production, puts, lid, uptick, 
The, real, goal, OPEC, Russia, spat, push, weaker, U, S, producers, market, COVID, 19, making, even, easier, since, putting, downward, pressure, energy, prices, With, backdrop, expect, giant, U, S, oil, driller, like, Exxon, pull, back, rapid, growth, onshore, U, S, energy, program, Its, onshore, growth, going, slow, complex, issue, seems, 
In, 2019, Exxon, U, S, shale, production, increased, incredible, 79, 2018, levels, That, growth, helped, push, oil, giant, full, production, higher, around, 3, first, uptick, several, And, still, early, days, region, Exxon, big, plans, In, fact, 2025, hopes, least, double, production, current, levels, 
Moreover, Exxon, openly, making, choice, invest, counter, cyclically, It, well, aware, oil, prices, weak, today, using, downturn, upgrade, portfolio, believes, advantageous, prices, In, fact, company, estimates, onshore, drilling, 25, cheaper, today, roughly, five, ago, Offshore, drilling, even, cheaper, costs, falling, 50, 
That, helps, explain, Exxon, still, planning, capital, investment, spending, much, 35, billion, 2025, To, fair, COVID, 19, scare, could, lead, pullback, Exxon, plans, unlikely, lead, massive, decline, That, company, believes, long, term, supply, demand, outlook, remains, favorable, higher, oil, prices, It, oil, major, believes, oil, stay, 
BRENT, CRUDE, OIL, SPOT, PRICE, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
However, even, Exxon, continues, push, U, S, shale, space, onshore, U, S, production, growth, start, slow, That, 80, growth, rate, unsustainable, At, rate, production, region, would, double, every, 1, 1, Trees, grow, sky, neither, oil, production, growth, Exxon, onshore, production, likely, continue, expand, production, growth, decline, time, even, total, output, continues, rise, It, simple, math, denominator, total, production, region, gets, bigger, growth, rate, start, slow, 
And, yet, oil, giant, really, stop, drilling, onshore, space, nature, wells, Shale, wells, relatively, quick, drill, However, production, tends, fall, quickly, wells, like, Exxon, building, offshore, Guyana, The, oil, giant, using, shale, effort, keep, production, works, longer, term, projects, essentially, bridging, would, otherwise, production, gap, And, stop, drilling, onshore, U, S, wells, start, slow, relatively, quickly, COVID, 19, may, lead, pullback, shale, drilling, highly, unlikely, materially, curtail, Exxon, efforts, region, That, doubly, true, look, oil, giant, robust, balance, sheet, allows, invest, even, market, weakness, 
Exxon, committed, onshore, U, S, space, needs, fast, production, offered, region, However, rapid, growth, seen, shale, sustained, long, math, involved, growth, continue, percentage, increases, fall, time, COVID, 19, clouds, outlook, energy, companies, could, lead, Exxon, pull, back, drilling, plans, However, assign, blame, COVID, 19, slowdown, growth, Exxon, U, S, onshore, production, step, back, look, entire, view, situation, Growth, destined, slow, rapid, levels, seen, 2019, regardless, coronavirus, Exxon, really, needs, U, S, production, keep, numbers, waits, production, investments, come, online, COVID, 19, important, issue, mix, hardly, one,
