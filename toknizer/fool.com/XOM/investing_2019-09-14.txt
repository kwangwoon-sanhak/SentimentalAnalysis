Exxon, basically, doubled, oil, natural, gas, ramping, exploration, budget, The, reason, fuels, depleting, assets, pull, barrel, oil, ground, gone, good, If, want, keep, drilling, need, keep, finding, oil, Management, stresses, even, aggressive, scenario, conservation, today, world, still, need, lots, new, oil, resources, That, said, ignoring, need, cleaner, energy, Exxon, focused, using, algae, make, oil, alternative, Algae, would, allow, Exxon, keep, using, core, infrastructure, 
Shell, looked, future, embraced, electricity, It, spending, billions, buy, invest, solar, power, wind, power, electric, auto, charging, stations, many, things, Its, hope, eventually, create, electric, business, stand, toe, toe, energy, operations, If, worried, global, warming, Shell, making, aggressive, shift, business,
