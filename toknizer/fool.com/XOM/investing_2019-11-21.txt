Since, 2012, Vermillion, seen, material, growth, production, via, mixture, acquisitions, capital, investmentm, 13, annualized, production, growth, rate, span, would, put, integrated, energy, majors, shame, That, said, 2020, expected, see, roughly, flat, production, based, company, current, projections, A, part, thanks, plan, reduce, capital, spending, nearly, 15, 2020, That, line, company, larger, goal, self, fund, growth, 
Self, funding, increasingly, important, approach, today, energy, markets, drillers, looking, live, within, means, That, tough, often, volatile, oil, prices, hovering, 50, 60, per, barrel, range, leave, much, room, profits, However, important, highlight, Vermillion, fracking, company, focused, U, S, unconventional, onshore, assets, cost, containment, huge, issue, Vermillion, tends, favor, conventional, drilling, assets, benefit, long, production, lives, relatively, low, costs, Vermillion, solid, foundation, regard, even, plans, pull, back, capital, spending, front, 
And, dividend, trended, higher, past, 16, This, period, included, company, changing, corporate, structure, Canadian, Royalty, Trust, regular, corporation, Many, companies, made, transition, ended, cutting, dividends, That, said, Vermillion, dividend, often, hits, multi, plateaus, growth, steady, predictable, The, dividend, however, paid, monthly, makes, kind, like, replacing, paycheck, 
So, problem, For, starters, Vermillion, spending, brings, door, many, Since, 2009, company, capital, expenditures, dividend, exceeded, funds, operations, FFO, To, make, difference, oil, company, issued, lot, shares, average, share, count, nearly, doubled, past, decade, debt, 630, past, 10, Since, stock, price, yield, inverse, relationship, come, surprise, company, 13, yield, backed, stock, 50, since, roughly, 2010, That, high, yield, meanwhile, makes, selling, shares, today, expensive, way, raise, capital,

While, low, yields, debt, market, far, better, option, raising, cash, material, increase, Vermillion, debt, also, problem, The, company, debt, equity, ratio, 0, 77, times, sound, bad, compare, Exxon, 0, 25, times, Chevron, 0, 21, times, Vermillion, ability, pay, interest, expenses, problem, The, Canadian, oil, company, times, interest, earned, ratio, around, 7, 25, Again, sounds, OK, compare, Chevron, 24, times, Exxon, 26, times, Vermillion, balance, sheet, strength, larger, peers, basically, built, weather, volatile, ups, downs, energy, market, 
All, looking, financially, strong, oil, driller, dividend, looks, secure, Vermillion, Another, leg, oil, prices, could, severely, pinch, oil, driller, ability, return, cash, shareholders, still, investing, business, That, key, reason, investors, pushed, stock, price, lower, yield, higher, Although, company, made, commitment, support, dividend, lived, dividend, cut, exactly, surprise, And, reason, hard, call, Vermillion, great, dividend, stock, 
Dividend, investors, tend, conservative, group, preferring, reliable, dividend, one, large, risk, cut, often, called, sucker, yield, While, Vermillion, certainly, proven, willing, support, dividend, even, spending, heavily, growth, comes, point, many, debt, equity, sales, catch, company, Add, fact, Vermillion, sells, highly, volatile, commodity, languishing, relatively, weak, prices, pretty, clear, investors, worried, That, concern, left, yield, lofty, levels, dividend, investors, probably, avoid, Vermillion, 
This, high, risk, fare, needs, close, monitoring, fine, want, But, definitely, great, dividend, stock, 
In, late, October, energy, giants, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, BP, NYSE, BP, delivered, third, quarter, 2019, earnings, reports, looked, pretty, bad, compared, ago, quarter, For, Exxon, earnings, per, share, declined, nearly, 50, 1, 46, 0, 75, BP, result, much, better, EPS, declining, 42, 0, 192, 0, 11, 
Like, integrated, oil, gas, companies, ExxonMobil, BP, coming, terms, new, reality, 50, 70, oil, Unlike, past, cycles, oil, prices, likely, remain, somewhat, low, result, U, S, shale, revolution, sparked, supply, increase, capable, keeping, global, demand, ExxonMobil, BP, similar, respects, one, superior, upside, 2020, beyond, 
Over, 80, Exxon, Q3, 2019, revenue, came, downstream, refining, business, yet, upstream, exploration, drilling, completions, production, made, nearly, 70, earnings, That, Exxon, upstream, business, higher, margins, downstream, business, historically, razor, thin, margins, 
Despite, low, margins, downstream, one, Exxon, main, competitive, advantages, surprise, company, positioning, favorable, future, IMO, 2020, goes, effect, Jan, 1, IMO, 2020, unofficial, name, given, International, Maritime, Organization, long, anticipated, regulatory, reduction, sulfur, emissions, IMO, 2020, big, deal, shippers, commodity, traders, refiners, investors, opens, new, markets, alternative, bunker, fuel, sources, Clean, burning, distillates, diesel, combined, high, sulfur, fuel, oil, used, commercial, ships, produce, low, low, sulfur, emitting, fuels,

In, response, question, IMO, 2020, August, quarterly, conference, call, Senior, Vice, President, Neil, A, Chapman, said, 
I, think, low, conversion, refineries, incented, run, reduce, sulfur, running, sweet, crudes, Our, refineries, particularly, Gulf, Coast, high, conversion, refineries, low, fuel, oil, production, And, would, say, feel, well, positioned, U, S, We, high, conversion, refineries, We, added, big, new, coker, Antwerp, And, investing, projects, reduce, high, sulfur, fuel, oil, production, Singapore, 
Exxon, growth, light, sweet, crude, oil, upstream, business, pairs, nicely, downstream, market, demand, lower, sulfur, solutions, shipping, industry, We, planning, long, long, time, said, Chapman, The, market, market, directionally, feel, like, sit, strong, advantaged, position, 
According, BP, CFO, Brian, Gilvary, BP, got, back, balance, 50, barrel, two, half, ago, The, company, strategy, straightforward, able, breakeven, oil, 50, barrel, lower, use, surplus, cash, pay, debt, buy, back, shares, pay, company, dividend, But, vast, majority, BP, earnings, like, Exxon, come, company, upstream, portfolio, earnings, declined, nearly, 50, since, third, quarter, 2018, 
One, reason, decline, BP, reliance, offshore, investment, lack, exposure, U, S, shale, revolution, Despite, consistent, downstream, portfolio, good, downstream, result, supported, oil, trading, third, quarter, 2019, Gilvary, said, CNBC, interview, BP, unable, replace, gaping, hole, earnings, upstream, used, provide, raising, question, dividend, sustainable, 
Before, recent, quarter, BP, trailing, 12, payout, ratio, percentage, earnings, goes, toward, paying, dividend, 90, After, quarter, trailing, 12, payout, ratio, 175, meaning, BP, dividend, quickly, outpacing, earnings, 
Although, BP, able, stabilize, debt, Q3, keeping, flat, quarter, quarter, hard, company, pay, debt, let, alone, take, dividend, outpacing, earnings, ExxonMobil, finds, similar, problematic, position, trailing, 12, payout, ratio, 80, Q3, earnings, sits, close, 100, 
Pressure, integrated, oil, company, earnings, straining, dividends, across, board, That, said, ExxonMobil, BP, posted, impressive, Q3, cash, flow, operations, well, excess, capital, expenditures, showing, underlying, businesses, strong, That, said, free, cash, flow, less, dividend, payment, ExxonMobil, close, dividend, payment, BP, With, Exxon, providing, inadequate, free, cash, flow, cover, dividend, BP, cutting, close, remains, unclear, whether, operating, cash, flow, good, enough, keep, future, dividend, payments, 
There, hiding, fact, ExxonMobil, BP, still, adjusting, current, low, oil, price, environment, That, said, Exxon, onshore, upstream, portfolio, pairs, nicely, downstream, portfolio, position, company, well, 2020, Investors, consider, waiting, see, much, Exxon, benefit, IMO, 2020, goes, effect, As, BP, company, trying, position, deal, 50, oil, already, challenge, simultaneously, buying, back, shares, paying, large, dividend, In, essence, BP, making, lot, promises, require, money, BP, could, end, straining, tries, balance, rewarding, shareholders, also, growing, business,
