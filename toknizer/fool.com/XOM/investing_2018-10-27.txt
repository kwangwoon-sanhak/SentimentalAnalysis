Hess, large, Bakken, Shale, position, key, growth, driver, company, near, long, term, helping, keep, moving, forward, Guyana, projects, start, coming, online, couple, Those, dual, growth, drivers, make, Hess, compelling, oil, growth, stock, long, term, In, Industry, Focus, Energy, clip, host, Nick, Sciple, Fool, com, contributor, Matt, DiLallo, discuss, 
A, full, transcript, follows, video, 
This, video, recorded, Oct, 25, 2018, 
Nick, Sciple, Let, talk, another, player, Bakken, region, That, Hess, Corporation, HES, Hess, plays, going, Bakken, They, also, involved, Guyana, They, partnered, Exxon, drill, one, largest, offshore, discoveries, recent, memory, Do, want, talk, going, Hess, What, going, Bakken, How, Bakken, fit, overall, strategy, business, 
Matt, DiLallo, Hess, interesting, name, They, really, reshaped, portfolio, last, couple, They, sold, lot, different, things, They, sold, Utica, shale, stuff, sold, lot, international, plays, But, kept, think, best, In, case, Bakken, Hess, one, better, drillers, They, manufacturing, process, taken, toward, drilling, wells, focused, cutting, costs, really, manufacturing, oil, drilling, wells, high, probability, delivering, certain, production, growth, rates, certain, returns, They, using, things, like, Bakken, Guyana, growth, engine, company, They, think, grow, production, Bakken, 15, 20, compound, annual, growth, rate, 2021, They, enough, inventory, drill, 15, 60, oil, Higher, oil, prices, free, inventory, There, plenty, growth, They, added, another, rig, earlier, plan, adding, another, rig, Lots, growth, Bakken, 
That, help, near, term, ExxonMobil, ramp, Guyana, find, truly, amazing, It, loads, loads, low, cost, oil, Hess, sees, next, growth, driver, probably, 2020, 2021, come, online, 
They, think, grow, cash, flow, 25, compound, annual, rate, come, These, two, plays, high, margin, produce, much, money, Hess, two, could, really, great, long, term, oil, company, 60, barrel, Really, interesting, long, term, name, 
Sciple, Let, talk, little, bit, Guyana, Hess, partnership, Exxon, relationship, Exxon, operator, How, advantageous, Hess, That, great, resource, partnering, large, oil, player, like, Exxon, 
DiLallo, Yeah, Exxon, one, better, companies, business, drilling, returns, They, phenomenal, interesting, metrics, like, returns, capital, employed, Because, focused, returns, benefits, Hess, Exxon, invest, play, going, produce, long, term, returns, good, returns, Exxon, sees, one, key, drivers, along, Permian, enabling, double, earnings, 2025, For, company, size, Exxon, huge, huge, growth, potential, So, Hess, partner, really, great, deal, Hess, Exxon, knows, drill, knows, produce, oil, I, like, Hess, specifically, locked, But, add, two, together, really, nice, company, follow, 
Sciple, When, look, management, presentations, talk, Guyana, Bakken, growth, drivers, plays, cash, flow, drivers, use, feed, growth, engines, That, assets, Malaysia, Deepwater, Gulf, Mexico, They, saying, plays, getting, 70, cash, operations, 2020, 20, capex, These, things, require, lot, capex, keep, throwing, cash, really, use, assets, generate, cash, really, invest, big, growth, drivers, like, mentioned, Guyana, Bakken, 
DiLallo, Right, That, something, investors, look, looking, oil, companies, Some, like, Continental, focused, shale, plays, These, pump, lot, money, upfront, produce, really, fast, Then, longer, term, things, like, offshore, oil, sands, LNG, They, take, lot, money, upfront, take, come, online, produce, lots, cash, production, come, That, Guyana, It, large, upfront, investment, future, turn, like, Malaysia, like, Gulf, Mexico, produce, cash, flow, come, little, long, term, investment, That, another, reason, I, like, Hess, company, Continental, It, cash, flow, drivers, make, steady, income, It, reduces, risk, oil, prices, collapse, see, Bakken, shale, probably, grow, fast, would, hurt, Continental, probably, hurt, Hess, long, term, growth, 
Sciple, We, wanted, mention, folks, income, investors, Hess, also, midstream, entity, buy, shares, It, 6, yield, It, growing, distribution, 15, Strong, financials, debt, Do, want, talk, opportunity, Hess, Midstream, vehicle, might, income, focused, investors, 
DiLallo, If, investors, want, exposed, oil, prices, Hess, Midstream, interesting, way, play, Bakken, without, exposure, oil, prices, It, basically, builds, gathering, pipelines, need, hook, oil, gas, wells, country, midstream, pipeline, system, It, helps, Hess, able, get, production, customers, It, basically, like, toll, booth, collect, steady, cash, flow, volumes, flow, They, able, take, cash, flow, reinvest, building, pipelines, processing, facilities, sort, thing, distributing, shareholders, 6, today, environment, pretty, good, safe, 6, They, debt, They, cover, dividend, well, cash, flow, They, lots, growth, ahead, helping, Hess, Hess, growing, production, 15, Those, volumes, flow, midstream, pipelines, generating, cash, flow, They, think, grow, distribution, 15, foreseeable, future, Add, potential, help, third, parties, I, think, really, interesting, way, play, Bakken, without, getting, exposure, oil, 
International, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, particularly, rewarding, investment, past, In, fact, stock, basically, treaded, water, past, 12, Before, jump, ship, buy, oil, stock, like, Anadarko, Petroleum, Corporation, NYSE, APC, 30, span, need, step, back, understand, implications, companies, business, models, Indeed, Anadarko, killing, right, Exxon, still, better, long, term, buy, conservative, investors, 
Although, Anadarko, Petroleum, owns, midstream, business, predominantly, operates, upstream, sector, oil, natural, gas, driller, Oil, sales, alone, made, around, 70, revenue, second, quarter, It, big, player, U, S, onshore, market, though, exposure, number, foreign, markets, including, Mexico, Africa, 
There, question, Anadarko, firing, cylinders, lately, Revenue, grew, 30, 2016, 2017, revenue, increases, first, second, quarters, suggesting, another, top, line, advance, 2018, highly, likely, Moreover, string, red, ink, oil, driller, black, first, half, And, expects, grow, oil, production, 13, 
If, believe, oil, prices, going, head, higher, least, fall, another, deep, downturn, Anadarko, pretty, interesting, stock, However, long, term, debt, makes, around, 50, company, capital, structure, Add, debt, controlled, limited, partnerships, breaks, separately, balance, sheet, number, goes, nearly, 60, 
That, lot, debt, company, whose, top, line, highly, dependent, volatile, commodity, one, capital, spending, huge, recurring, cost, company, planning, invest, roughly, 4, billion, drilling, side, alone, In, fact, first, six, Anadarko, spent, cash, capital, expenditures, generated, operations, If, oil, prices, fall, like, mid, 2014, unusual, event, energy, space, Anadarko, could, quickly, find, forced, pull, back, capital, plans, bottom, line, likely, falling, back, red, It, could, also, end, cutting, dividend, like, 2016, painful, 80, 
It, exact, environment, diversified, conservative, company, like, Exxon, shines, For, example, Exxon, managed, remain, profitable, throughout, last, oil, downturn, using, rock, solid, balance, sheet, support, capital, spending, steadily, grow, dividend, In, fact, 36, annual, dividend, increases, boasts, dividend, record, none, peers, match, Anadarko, hold, nearly, well, period, disparate, stock, price, performance, highlights, difference, Exxon, fell, around, 23, Anadarko, lost, two, thirds, value, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
There, two, big, differences, need, focus, First, Exxon, business, broadly, diversified, across, energy, value, chain, Upstream, biggest, business, also, sizable, chemicals, refining, operations, Downstream, assets, like, tend, benefit, falling, oil, prices, since, oil, key, input, That, offset, pain, oil, declines, steeply, provide, meaningful, counterbalance, 
A, real, life, example, might, help, In, 2015, oil, prices, still, steep, decline, Exxon, upstream, business, saw, earnings, fall, 75, However, downstream, earnings, doubled, The, end, result, roughly, 50, decline, overall, earnings, Not, great, much, better, would, happened, Exxon, diversified, portfolio, 
Exxon, balance, sheet, meanwhile, provides, another, safety, valve, The, company, debt, load, doubled, oil, downturn, started, mid, 2014, That, said, long, term, debt, peaked, around, 15, capital, structure, And, around, 10, today, Exxon, conservative, management, team, focused, debt, reduction, essentially, preparing, balance, sheet, next, oil, downturn, There, little, question, Exxon, keep, spending, future, returning, value, investors, via, dividends, oil, prices, fall, 
So, Exxon, lackluster, investment, The, answer, production, weak, returns, capital, employed, fallen, leading, pack, middle, road, It, tough, stay, positive, company, simply, able, fully, benefit, current, oil, upturn, one, helped, Anadarko, thrive, Exxon, aware, problems, faces, plans, right, ship, taking, long, term, conservative, approach, like, always, favoring, profitable, investments, quick, short, term, fixes, 
This, long, term, investors, particularly, interested, Exxon, today, Its, yield, around, 4, historically, high, price, tangible, book, value, historically, low, And, oil, prices, decline, financially, solid, ground, deal, headwind, without, skipping, beat, 
There, good, reasons, Anadarko, stock, outperformed, Exxon, past, likely, continue, oil, prices, strong, However, look, highly, cyclical, industry, like, oil, drilling, examine, full, cycle, recent, upturn, When, pull, back, look, well, two, companies, performed, last, downturn, well, balance, sheets, prepared, future, oil, price, turbulence, Exxon, looks, like, desirable, investment, That, particularly, true, income, investors, conservative, bent,
