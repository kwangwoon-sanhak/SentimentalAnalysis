There, glut, oil, world, today, There, number, reasons, including, emergence, U, S, onshore, drilling, major, global, player, last, decade, OPEC, Russia, getting, temporary, oil, price, war, concluded, global, economic, shutdowns, related, world, effort, slow, spread, COVID, 19, Each, one, items, could, written, extensively, big, picture, supply, elevated, time, demand, fallen, dramatically, quickly, 
There, much, oil, fact, companies, trouble, storing, The, world, ability, store, oil, limited, point, storage, tanks, nearly, full, They, even, begun, enlisting, Suezmax, ships, usually, ferry, oil, around, world, act, floating, oil, tanks, Tanker, rates, exploded, higher, While, boon, companies, like, Nordic, American, Tankers, shows, bad, oversupply, situation, really, So, little, wonder, oil, prices, moribund, oil, company, shares, punished, 
However, Mr, Market, fickle, mood, change, dime, Today, prices, types, oil, risen, much, 30, Normally, would, massive, move, actually, line, recent, ups, downs, energy, sector, There, two, pieces, good, news, driving, upbeat, view, First, economies, starting, reopen, essentially, shutting, deal, spread, COVID, 19, That, means, demand, fallen, cliff, likely, start, coming, back, 
The, bit, good, news, industry, update, American, Petroleum, Institute, showing, U, S, oil, inventories, built, quite, much, expected, That, suggests, may, much, extra, oil, floating, around, people, think, And, turn, working, extra, inventory, might, take, long, industry, watchers, feared, Before, getting, excited, however, expected, inventory, increase, 10, 6, million, barrels, actual, number, came, 10, million, barrels, The, direction, right, actual, numbers, huge, 
Still, bits, upbeat, news, backdrop, investors, bid, shares, oil, giants, Exxon, Chevron, higher, These, stocks, tend, make, huge, percentage, moves, diversified, businesses, span, energy, spectrum, upstream, drilling, downstream, refining, chemicals, mid, single, digit, advances, pretty, notable, However, stock, prices, smaller, players, like, Vermilion, get, pretty, volatile, Thus, mood, shift, lifted, shares, heavily, leveraged, oil, company, double, digits, cooler, heads, prevailed, gain, came, high, single, digits, 
The, ultimate, truth, another, day, volatile, commodity, working, major, supply, demand, imbalance, Yes, big, oil, price, swings, impact, prices, oil, companies, like, Exxon, Chevron, Vermilion, But, still, lot, work, done, around, world, energy, demand, gets, back, pre, COVID, 19, levels, And, even, happens, oil, storage, still, needs, worked, vital, energy, source, mount, sustained, upturn, The, news, good, today, investors, need, prepared, bad, news, tomorrow, Energy, stocks, likely, remain, volatile, come, world, adjusts, dramatic, changes, taken, shape, oil, market, 
The, 2020, oil, market, crash, proving, unprecedented, We, seen, oil, prices, fall, lowest, levels, record, massive, collapse, demand, global, economy, put, essentially, neutral, storage, situation, making, things, even, worse, That, going, push, benefit, economic, recovery, even, It, take, many, soak, oil, storage, producers, ramp, production, back, 
In, interim, many, weakest, companies, going, run, money, large, shale, producer, major, offshore, driller, filed, bankruptcy, protection, already, going, join, 
But, group, companies, oil, industry, financial, strength, diversified, operations, ride, even, proving, worst, oil, crash, history, Collectively, known, Big, Oil, integrated, supermajors, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, BP, NYSE, B, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, along, mega, producers, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, names, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, giant, refining, pipelines, petrochemicals, viewed, safest, investments, oil, patch, These, companies, financial, wherewithal, outlast, downturn, come, side, solid, shape, 
But, investors, buying, Big, Oil, right, Sure, best, prepared, companies, come, downturn, whether, worth, buying, depends, goals, expectations, We, asked, four, top, contributors, cover, energy, industry, weigh, thoughts, Here, say, Big, Oil, whether, invest, right, 
John, Bromels, I, pretty, bearish, oil, industry, general, right, Big, Oil, companies, typical, oil, stocks, Whether, buy, sell, right, though, depends, lot, hoping, get, portfolio, 
The, bulk, Big, Oil, companies, revenue, comes, producing, oil, gas, Low, oil, prices, sure, wreak, havoc, top, lines, smaller, production, companies, The, integrated, majors, also, refining, marketing, arms, less, dependent, oil, prices, demand, gasoline, petrochemicals, demand, taken, big, hit, 
In, words, revenue, earnings, likely, horrible, coronavirus, pandemic, wane, If, looking, preserve, capital, distressed, stock, bounce, back, quickly, probably, look, elsewhere, 
That, said, five, integrated, majors, announced, spending, cuts, 2020, effort, preserve, cash, dividends, That, tactic, used, successfully, oil, price, downturn, 2014, 2017, Because, recent, share, price, drops, dividend, yields, pretty, attractive, right, BP, Shell, yielding, double, digits, ExxonMobil, yields, 2020, time, highs, company, 
If, long, term, dividend, investor, stomach, lot, short, term, volatility, risk, buying, shares, Big, Oil, company, bad, idea, right, Other, investors, though, want, steer, clear, 
Matt, DiLallo, It, seems, lower, oil, prices, go, interested, investors, oil, stocks, Fueling, curiosity, view, crude, eventually, bounce, back, taking, oil, stocks, The, problem, oil, company, needs, survive, downturn, around, eventual, rebound, 
Most, big, oil, stocks, make, since, boast, large, scale, operations, low, operating, costs, relatively, strong, balance, sheets, However, mean, come, unscathed, Occidental, Petroleum, NYSE, OXY, example, slash, dividend, stay, afloat, took, much, debt, wrestle, Anadarko, Petroleum, away, Chevron, last, Others, could, join, cutting, payouts, BP, Shell, concerning, given, double, digit, yields, moment, 
One, oil, stocks, however, built, business, downturn, mind, ConocoPhillips, Because, oil, giant, spent, past, several, selling, higher, cost, assets, using, cash, build, fortress, like, balance, sheet, entered, 8, 4, billion, cash, second, lowest, leverage, ratio, sector, Meanwhile, quickly, adjusted, lower, oil, prices, slashing, cash, outflows, 5, billion, well, holding, back, oil, supplies, pricing, improves, That, combination, financial, strength, flexibility, makes, stand, one, big, oil, stocks, worth, investor, consideration, right, 
Travis, Hoium, Big, oil, stocks, moneymakers, normally, think, Over, past, decade, competition, kept, oil, prices, low, lots, new, technologies, shale, drilling, ultra, deepwater, extraction, low, margin, historical, terms, demand, growing, way, used, Add, returns, become, pretty, anemic, big, oil, stocks, getting, worse, time, 
XOM, RETURN, ON, ASSETS, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
What, ask, thinking, buying, oil, stocks, today, conditions, better, two, My, answer, 
Renewable, energy, electric, vehicles, steadily, gaining, market, share, eating, away, traditional, sources, fossil, fuel, demand, Demand, growth, also, slowed, negative, U, S, people, move, cities, reduce, commutes, vehicles, get, fuel, efficient, I, see, trends, changing, next, decade, think, big, oil, prove, good, long, term, investment, either, 
Jason, Hall, My, view, oil, supermajors, bit, mixed, On, one, hand, I, little, doubt, survive, current, crisis, Oil, demand, going, recover, global, economy, opens, back, eventually, drive, oil, prices, higher, I, relatively, certain, today, prices, prove, profitable, anyone, buys, Big, Oil, stocks, sits, couple, I, bought, Phillips, 66, I, think, big, winner, recovery, 
But, long, term, investments, I, side, Travis, lean, toward, long, term, trends, even, Big, Oil, Over, next, decade, I, expect, see, global, oil, demand, start, peak, even, energy, demand, goes, higher, renewables, take, share, mix, getting, cheaper, cleaner, fossil, fuels, 
If, looking, profit, short, term, crash, oil, prices, company, like, Phillips, 66, radar, business, built, withstand, downturn, oil, prices, quickly, rebound, demand, refined, products, petrochemicals, recovers, But, looking, stock, buy, today, hold, decade, renewable, energy, producer, like, Brookfield, Renewable, Partners, NYSE, BEP, sells, low, cost, wind, solar, hydroelectric, power, utilities, would, first, pick, Not, business, better, long, term, prospects, also, far, stable, less, volatile, anything, related, oil, gas, 
You, also, buy, today, 19, discount, 2020, high, That, may, kind, 50, bargain, see, Big, Oil, business, much, higher, ceiling, without, risks, come, investing, oil,
