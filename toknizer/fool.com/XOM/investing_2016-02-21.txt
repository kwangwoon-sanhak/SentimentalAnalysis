Breitburn, Energy, Partners, LP, OTC, BBEPQ, distribution, toast, The, oil, gas, driller, supposed, provide, steady, stream, income, using, limited, partnership, model, expand, production, help, unit, holders, limit, tax, hit, Plunging, oil, prices, put, end, But, mean, find, solid, income, options, oil, gas, space, Here, three, consider, 
The, best, world, 
If, like, oil, gas, least, think, oil, rout, beaten, sector, point, creating, upside, potential, one, place, look, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, The, current, yield, around, 3, 6, That, certainly, nothing, write, home, competitors, BP, NYSE, BP, sport, yields, high, 8, But, important, difference, Exxon, probably, best, run, oil, company, world, And, impossible, say, oil, company, immune, dividend, cut, particularly, deep, industry, downturn, Exxon, holding, well, relative, peers, 
EXXONMOBIL, LOGO, SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, 
For, example, Exxon, able, generate, nearly, 33, billion, cash, flow, 2015, 33, Capital, spending, 31, billion, BP, much, less, wiggle, room, cash, flow, around, 19, 1, billion, last, drop, nearly, 42, capital, expenditures, 18, 7, billion, 
But, future, even, telling, As, Exxon, heads, 2016, pegged, capital, spending, 23, 1, billion, cut, around, 25, That, makes, sense, oil, prices, continue, weak, cash, flow, likely, fall, BP, best, case, scenario, capital, spending, 2016, meanwhile, cut, 10, capital, spending, could, also, rise, slightly, 19, billion, based, current, projections, In, words, looks, like, Exxon, much, better, position, ride, downturn, still, generating, enough, cash, flow, cover, capital, spending, plans, 
This, one, example, shows, reason, BP, yields, much, Exxon, among, lowest, yielding, oil, majors, If, got, burned, Breitburn, distribution, cut, still, want, oil, gas, exposure, might, time, err, side, caution, Exxon, one, safest, oil, gas, majors, around, 
XOM, DIVIDEND, YIELD, TTM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Moving, oil, gas, 
Another, option, might, want, consider, moving, oil, natural, gas, instead, drilling, There, plethora, beaten, limited, partnerships, pick, However, one, largest, best, run, Enterprise, Products, Partners, NYSE, EPD, The, partnership, broadly, diversified, business, long, history, successful, operations, expansion, hit, badly, downturn, 
For, example, 2015, Enterprise, posted, earnings, 1, 26, unit, 1, 47, 2014, That, drop, around, 14, Exxon, despite, one, best, oil, gas, drillers, vast, chemical, refining, operations, saw, earnings, decline, nearly, 50, It, also, worth, pointing, Enterprise, distributable, cash, flow, cash, pay, unit, holders, actually, increased, around, 30, 
What, behind, Enterprise, financial, results, It, largely, toll, taker, charging, customers, moving, products, across, nearly, 50, 000, miles, pipelines, holding, geographically, diverse, storage, facilities, It, driller, might, interested, Enterprise, energy, downturn, much, exposure, commodity, prices, 
One, thing, like, Enterprise, external, general, partner, eating, valuable, cash, flow, That, gives, advantage, cost, side, allowed, cover, distribution, 1, 3, times, 2015, And, CEO, Jim, Teague, talking, 5, boost, 2016, assuming, board, approves, plan, With, distribution, yield, around, 7, 5, sounds, like, plan, investors, could, get, behind, taking, deep, hit, names, like, Breitburn, 
Another, LP, consider, Buckeye, Partners, NYSE, BPL, yield, hovering, around, 9, Like, Enterprise, Buckeye, owns, pipelines, storage, facilities, terminals, With, oil, available, demand, sop, storage, good, business, According, CEO, Clark, Smith, third, quarter, We, successful, increasing, utilization, well, rates, across, domestic, Caribbean, assets, contributed, significant, incremental, cash, flows, It, good, demand, assets, And, U, S, opens, boarders, global, oil, trade, Buckeye, oil, terminals, also, demand, 
That, said, Buckeye, distributable, cash, flow, fell, third, quarter, leading, coverage, ratio, 0, 89, So, risk, Enterprise, But, like, Enterprise, Buckeye, big, toll, taker, working, sizable, growth, project, Texas, expects, improve, coverage, ratio, allow, future, distribution, growth, If, stomach, little, near, term, uncertainty, Buckeye, might, worth, deep, dive, extra, 1, 5, percentage, points, yield, 
BPL, Dividend, Yield, TTM, data, YCharts, 
Can, forget, burn, 
It, would, understandable, lived, Breitburn, distribution, cut, steep, share, price, decline, decided, wanted, nothing, oil, gas, But, truth, downturn, opened, opportunities, good, companies, Exxon, example, yielded, much, today, nearly, 20, Enterprise, Buckeye, also, yielding, recent, And, perhaps, equally, important, three, companies, long, histories, annual, dividend, increases, Enterprise, streak, shortest, 19, Sure, one, could, cut, disbursements, like, Breitburn, history, current, results, suggest, risk, worth, taking,
