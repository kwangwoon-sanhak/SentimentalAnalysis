Oil, prices, fallen, multi, decade, lows, COVID, 19, pandemic, brought, economic, industrial, activity, halt, around, world, Oil, consumption, plunged, 30, expected, decline, average, 10, full, As, result, world, awash, massive, oversupply, crude, oil, expected, keep, oil, prices, low, many, expected, cause, take, much, longer, oil, industry, benefit, eventual, recovery, economic, activity, 
That, made, massive, swath, oil, patch, uninvestable, We, already, seen, companies, start, file, bankruptcy, number, becomes, insolvent, going, grow, longer, weeks, ahead, In, words, likely, get, worse, many, companies, oil, gas, industry, gets, better, 
But, companies, financial, strength, high, quality, operations, ride, downturn, emerge, side, fine, shape, To, help, investors, get, started, finding, best, companies, oil, industry, survive, oil, crash, asked, four, Motley, Fool, contributors, weigh, They, identified, following, oil, stocks, consider, Global, oil, production, giant, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, Big, Oil, giants, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, B, NYSE, RDS, A, ExxonMobil, Corp, NYSE, XOM, midstream, refining, petrochemicals, giant, Phillips, 66, NYSE, PSX, 
Matt, DiLallo, ConocoPhillips, Oil, giant, ConocoPhillips, spent, past, several, repositioning, business, another, oil, market, crash, It, found, bit, underprepared, market, downturn, 2014, drove, desire, make, sure, able, withstand, another, swoon, It, made, several, changes, including, selling, higher, cost, assets, using, proceeds, strengthen, balance, sheet, 
Because, ConocoPhillips, entered, crash, much, better, position, peers, Not, one, lowest, cost, operations, sector, also, one, strongest, balance, sheets, It, started, 5, 4, billion, cash, another, 3, billion, short, term, investments, paired, second, lowest, leverage, ratio, oil, industry, That, fortress, like, balance, sheet, help, keep, afloat, current, market, slump, 
The, company, also, stress, tested, long, term, business, plan, assume, three, low, oil, prices, mitigations, Even, scenario, balance, sheet, held, However, built, lot, flexibility, plan, could, adjust, market, conditions, That, allowed, act, quickly, downturn, ensure, survives, Recently, ConocoPhillips, suspended, share, repurchase, program, slashed, capital, spending, reduced, expenses, Those, moves, preserve, 5, billion, cash, 
These, factors, enhance, ConocoPhillips, ability, survive, 2020, oil, market, crash, Furthermore, financial, strength, positions, potentially, take, advantage, situation, acquiring, rival, depressed, value, 
Jason, Hall, Phillips, 66, I, agree, Matt, ConocoPhillips, rare, pure, play, oil, producer, built, ride, current, environment, But, I, think, part, business, separated, 2012, spin, Phillips, 66, better, business, right, While, ConocoPhillips, certainly, financial, strength, ride, current, extreme, low, price, environment, refining, petrochemicals, pipeline, business, makes, Phillips, 66, prove, less, impacted, quicker, see, benefits, eventual, economic, recovery, 
Phillips, 66, core, business, little, insulated, oil, crash, It, produce, oil, caught, boat, companies, oil, production, selling, product, less, costs, produce, Next, petrochemicals, business, held, relatively, well, Much, demand, exclusive, transportation, feedstocks, makes, used, products, like, fertilizers, plastics, medical, industrial, consumer, products, Additionally, much, pipeline, business, focused, natural, gas, used, petrochemicals, energy, production, Neither, demand, sources, seen, anything, like, collapse, oil, 
So, yes, refining, fuel, marketing, businesses, feel, big, pinch, Gasoline, jet, fuel, demand, fallen, half, inventories, refined, products, starting, fill, But, 5, billion, cash, liquidity, tap, pinch, company, survive, even, protracted, downturn, companies, fail, Most, importantly, businesses, likely, see, quicker, increase, demand, economy, start, coming, back, online, 
John, Bromels, Royal, Dutch, Shell, Some, best, positioned, companies, weather, oil, price, crash, course, integrated, oil, majors, Thanks, size, comparative, strength, balance, sheets, credit, ratings, simply, financial, flexibility, power, prolonged, period, low, oil, prices, And, extensive, downstream, refining, marketing, operations, 100, dependent, energy, prices, way, smaller, exploration, production, companies,
