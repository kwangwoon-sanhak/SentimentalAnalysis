ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, recently, released, updated, energy, outlook, 2040, That, outlook, sees, global, energy, demand, growing, average, 1, per, 2010, 2014, The, fastest, growth, come, renewables, like, solar, wind, biofuels, However, might, surprise, important, energy, source, meet, future, demand, growth, according, Exxon, actually, natural, gas, As, following, slide, shows, natural, gas, expected, see, largest, absolute, growth, becomes, key, fuel, meeting, future, energy, demand,

While, outlook, still, projects, oil, remain, overall, leader, meeting, world, energy, demand, sees, natural, gas, moving, past, coal, world, No, 2, fuel, source, More, importantly, natural, gas, expected, provide, energy, needed, meet, future, demand, nearly, energy, sources, combined, 
Why, natural, gas, 
Natural, gas, one, flexible, fuel, sources, Not, used, heat, homes, businesses, winter, used, industrial, feedstock, make, plastics, fertilizers, well, option, transportation, fuel, On, top, quickly, becoming, vital, fuel, source, electricity, generation, 
That, really, key, next, slide, shows, electricity, generation, expected, lead, growth, energy, demand, next, decades,

This, surge, energy, needed, electricity, demand, drive, growth, renewable, cleaner, fuels, like, solar, wind, nuclear, hydroelectric, This, fuel, sources, enjoy, much, faster, average, growth, rates, That, said, growth, fuel, sources, really, make, much, dent, meeting, future, demand, Nor, energy, sources, supplants, demand, coal, expected, see, relatively, flat, demand, next, decades, Instead, natural, gas, responsible, supporting, energy, demand, growth, edges, coal, compared, competing, fuels, favorable, benefits, competing, energy, sources, 
As, see, following, chart, natural, gas, used, power, generation, best, combination, low, cost, low, emissions, profile, availability, key, fuel, source, future, 
SOURCE, EXXONMOBIL, CORPORATION, 
These, favorable, characteristics, increased, demand, natural, gas, used, electricity, generation, expected, rather, widespread, around, world, It, expected, deliver, new, electricity, generation, key, growth, countries, like, Mexico, Turkey, supplanting, coal, developed, nations, see, next, chart,

As, slide, notes, area, gas, expected, make, inroads, India, expected, remain, predominantly, coal, powered, Meanwhile, natural, gas, expected, struggle, make, inroads, China, turning, toward, nuclear, support, future, demand, growth, That, said, pretty, clear, natural, gas, key, fuel, powering, world, decades, ahead, 
Key, takeaway, 
Wind, solar, might, fastest, growing, energy, sources, natural, gas, expected, vital, energy, fuel, source, meet, demand, growth, ahead, Not, flexible, fuel, meet, needs, transportation, industrial, residential, commercial, key, benefits, make, fuel, choice, generating, electricity, This, outlook, suggests, bright, future, natural, gas, industry, key, producers, like, ExxonMobil, product, vitally, important, meeting, world, need, energy,
