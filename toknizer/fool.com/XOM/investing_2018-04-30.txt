Let, take, look, ExxonMobil, recent, results, seem, weak, comparatively, investor, faced, could, string, disappointing, earnings, near, future,

As, stock, ExxonMobil, incredibly, polarizing, On, one, hand, recent, earnings, results, left, lot, desired, compared, peers, On, seven, growth, plan, might, make, mouth, water, The, trouble, real, needle, moving, projects, plan, go, live, 2020, later, 
That, leaves, investors, bit, quandary, Should, buy, ExxonMobil, cheap, wait, post, 2020, payout, run, sizable, aspiring, bill, banging, head, table, every, earnings, report, put, money, better, performing, big, oil, player, today, check, Exxon, later, I, think, answer, lies, somewhere, middle, For, already, invested, worth, hanging, letting, forehead, bruises, accumulate, cash, burning, hole, pocket, may, best, look, adding, Exxon, peers, portfolio, 
Oil, simultaneously, one, interesting, challenging, sectors, invest, past, The, effects, oil, price, slump, persisted, 2014, 2016, continue, ripple, across, sector, led, many, investors, shun, industry, Yet, crude, oil, prices, rise, many, companies, still, trade, rather, attractive, valuations, 
So, asked, three, investing, contributors, highlight, oil, industry, stock, think, worth, second, look, today, Here, picked, Hi, Crush, Partners, OTC, HCRS, Q, Kinder, Morgan, NYSE, KMI, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Tyler, Crowe, Hi, Crush, Partners, When, shale, oil, boom, getting, started, five, ago, seemed, like, Wall, Street, throw, money, frack, sand, suppliers, fast, enough, Shale, thing, high, projected, demand, sand, meant, suppliers, spending, wildly, add, capacity, When, oil, crash, hit, though, sand, demand, dried, quickly, producers, became, less, eager, drill, new, wells, led, lot, excess, capacity, weak, margins, overleveraged, balance, sheets, 
Hi, Crush, Partners, one, hardest, hit, Its, debt, load, ballooned, unsustainable, levels, management, forced, cut, payout, issue, new, shares, incredibly, low, valuations, meet, cash, needs, Based, recent, history, I, understand, investors, might, shy, away, stock, 
If, willing, put, past, behind, however, see, company, actually, looks, attractive, right, Demand, frack, sand, rise, Hi, Crush, mines, running, high, utilization, rates, It, expanded, operations, red, hot, Permian, Basin, last, mile, logistics, offerings, improving, margins, every, ton, sold, All, elements, allowed, significantly, repair, balance, sheet, company, returned, paying, sizable, distribution, even, starting, buy, back, shares, reverse, dilution, resorted, previously, 
The, oil, price, crash, compelled, producers, companies, serving, industry, become, prudent, capital, allocation, financial, management, It, appears, Hi, Crush, management, taking, hard, lessons, learned, slump, boom, cycle, There, always, chance, sand, prices, could, swing, wildly, response, shifts, oil, gas, demand, appears, Hi, Crush, better, position, handle, 
Travis, Hoium, Kinder, Morgan, Kinder, Morgan, one, leading, pipeline, companies, United, States, transporting, petroleum, products, independent, operator, moving, 40, natural, gas, consumed, domestically, What, I, like, Kinder, Morgan, less, dependent, oil, natural, gas, prices, companies, sector, Its, business, focused, fee, based, transportation, 66, 2018, EBDA, earnings, depreciation, amortization, expected, come, take, pay, contracts, 
In, 2018, management, expects, business, generate, adjusted, EBITDA, 7, 49, billion, distributable, cash, flow, 2, 05, per, share, Given, current, dividend, 0, 80, per, share, suggests, ample, room, grow, payouts, long, term, Management, expects, generate, excess, cash, flow, 568, million, 2018, alone, could, used, pay, debt, fund, growth, 
Kinder, Morgan, enterprise, value, 72, 4, billion, 9, 7, times, expected, 2018, EBITDA, I, think, reasonable, price, company, well, positioned, take, advantage, long, term, growth, oil, natural, gas, consumption, United, States, From, dividend, perspective, stock, yields, 4, 9, current, price, strong, yield, investors, bullish, sector, based, management, projections, plenty, opportunity, boost, dividend, future, 
Reuben, Gregg, Brewer, ExxonMobil, ExxonMobil, one, world, largest, integrated, oil, companies, portfolio, diversified, across, entire, oil, natural, gas, value, chain, Its, peers, stock, prices, rose, last, higher, oil, prices, boosted, financial, results, ExxonMobil, stock, price, however, fallen, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
There, valid, reasons, among, ExxonMobil, peers, caught, usually, industry, leading, return, capital, employed, numbers, energy, giant, production, fell, recent, However, likely, temporary, issues, It, recently, presented, plans, boost, return, metric, single, digits, mid, teens, working, key, production, boosting, projects, onshore, United, States, well, offshore, Mozambique, Guyana, The, problem, Exxon, giant, ship, takes, time, turn, 
But, also, opportunity, investors, think, long, term, Short, term, concerns, pushed, ExxonMobil, price, tangible, book, value, ratio, low, levels, seen, since, 1980s, Its, yield, meanwhile, around, 3, 9, high, end, historical, range, But, Exxon, remains, one, conservatively, run, oil, majors, incredibly, strong, balance, sheet, long, term, debt, example, makes, 12, capital, structure, If, act, soon, could, miss, chance, collect, big, yield, wait, management, complete, plans, 
We, fossil, fuels, today, bunch, algae, biomass, sank, bottom, dinosaur, laden, swamps, tens, millions, ago, compressed, time, current, form, Or, something, like, 
Crude, oil, natural, gas, coal, dominate, energy, landscape, modern, world, nowhere, dominance, absolute, transportation, sector, almost, entirely, dependent, liquid, petroleum, fuels, While, looks, increasingly, likely, electric, vehicles, grab, significant, market, share, coming, decades, liquid, fuels, coughing, entire, market, anytime, soon, That, fact, encouraged, many, companies, pursue, novel, renewable, fuels, relatively, little, show, terms, commercialized, technologies, 
While, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, well, aware, recent, history, maintained, long, term, focus, one, biotech, holy, grails, limitless, volumes, drop, algae, fuels, Exxon, money, It, technical, prowess, It, time, Can, oil, supermajor, successfully, use, synthetic, biology, tools, commercialize, algae, fuels, 
ExxonMobil, ultimate, goal, commercialize, genetically, engineered, algae, strain, capable, producing, economically, viable, renewable, fuels, chemicals, large, outdoor, facilities, And, taking, practical, steps, get, 
For, one, thing, partnered, cutting, edge, synthetic, biology, company, Synthetic, Genomics, SGI, SGI, number, groundbreaking, accomplishments, belt, It, created, first, synthetic, organism, descended, computer, program, discovered, minimal, viable, genome, needed, boot, life, 31, genes, unknown, functions, even, building, device, could, synthesize, microbes, found, Mars, transmitted, radio, signal, among, uses, 
Put, another, way, SGI, wishy, washy, start, high, hype, low, execution, Instead, exactly, ExxonMobil, needs, especially, given, daunting, hurdles, horizon, 
That, technical, expertise, already, paid, dividends, In, 2017, ExxonMobil, SGI, announced, discovered, way, make, algae, strain, twice, efficient, producing, oil, without, affecting, growth, rates, best, worlds, past, efforts, increase, oil, production, resulted, slower, growing, organisms, 
But, reminder, difficulty, predictably, controlling, biology, breakthrough, still, starting, point, ExxonMobil, SGI, remain, long, way, commercial, scale, facility, although, shareholders, circle, calendar, next, step, toward, goal, 2025, 
That, ExxonMobil, SGI, believe, could, technical, ability, create, facility, 10, 000, barrels, per, day, next, generation, algae, fuel, That, works, 130, million, gallons, per, equivalent, large, corn, ethanol, facility, Building, algal, fuel, facility, much, complex, though, Unlike, ethanol, produced, ideal, conditions, sealed, stainless, steel, tanks, algae, production, process, developed, utilize, open, air, facilities, need, fight, contamination, host, concerns, remain, unchartered, territory, industrial, algal, cultivation, 
Long, story, short, developing, technical, ability, create, economically, viable, algae, fuels, thing, actually, producing, economically, viable, algae, fuels, The, first, commercial, scale, facility, still, 10, away, best, case, scenario, But, payoff, success, would, almost, unimaginable, 
Let, assume, ExxonMobil, SGI, produce, 10, 000, gallons, fuel, per, acre, per, algae, companies, targeted, past, That, works, 6, 4, million, gallons, per, square, mile, per, At, level, production, technology, could, technically, provide, 250, billion, gallons, motor, gasoline, diesel, jet, fuel, consumed, United, States, 40, 000, square, miles, production, 
It, sounds, like, lot, land, perspective, The, important, crude, oil, patch, world, right, Permian, Basin, sprawls, across, 75, 000, square, miles, West, Texas, eastern, New, Mexico, By, 2021, shale, formation, could, churn, 5, million, barrels, oil, per, day, would, equivalent, 30, total, American, transportation, fuels, consumption, 
Microscopic, photosynthetic, factories, competing, Permian, Basin, time, soon, maybe, ever, potential, goes, show, ExxonMobil, investing, biotechnology, ultra, long, mindset, After, company, robust, portfolio, refining, infrastructure, could, use, process, crude, algae, biomass, renewable, fuels, chemicals, Swinging, fences, outdoor, algae, cultivation, sounds, lot, better, potentially, write, significant, part, refining, asset, base, future, governments, penalize, carbon, intensive, petroleum, based, products,

It, surprising, ExxonMobil, along, supermajor, peers, pouring, capital, next, generation, renewable, fuels, development, The, first, technology, prove, economically, viable, could, forever, change, future, energy, entire, planet, Of, course, still, waiting, first, success, innumerable, failures, 
It, might, seem, little, counterintuitive, ExxonMobil, exact, right, position, deliver, outcome, It, ample, cash, flow, divert, unproven, industrial, biotech, processes, many, takes, prove, successful, long, progress, made, along, way, It, also, partnered, leading, company, field, 
So, long, term, perspective, encouraging, ExxonMobil, slowly, making, progress, toward, goal, commercializing, algae, fuels, But, also, important, remember, partnership, SGI, still, early, stages, development, major, technical, hurdles, remain, That, said, ongoing, project, good, bet, algae, fuels, might, waiting, 2030s, outcome, determined,
