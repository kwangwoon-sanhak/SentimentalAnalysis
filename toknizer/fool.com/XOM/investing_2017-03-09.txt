Exxon, one, largest, integrated, oil, companies, world, increased, dividend, every, 34, That, impressive, streak, The, yield, currently, around, 3, 6, However, downturn, cash, flow, enough, pay, dividends, make, necessary, capital, investments, keep, business, growing, Like, peers, relied, debt, markets, 
Long, term, debt, increased, roughly, 7, billion, 4, capital, structure, start, 2014, 29, billion, end, 2016, around, 15, That, big, increase, hardly, unreasonable, level, debt, Exxon, remains, one, best, financed, companies, industry, 
There, question, Exxon, facing, serious, headwinds, That, said, history, well, run, return, invested, capital, historically, among, highest, industry, making, plans, increase, investment, key, areas, including, onshore, U, S, drilling, push, growth, oil, prices, stabilized, many, competitors, still, pulling, back, There, risks, today, financially, strong, Exxon, appears, well, positioned, handle, support, dividend, 
Exxon, spending, plan, onshore, U, S, drilling, important, Helmerich, Payne, leading, provider, high, tech, drilling, rigs, United, States, Helmerich, business, highly, cyclical, huge, ups, deep, downs, For, example, end, fiscal, 2016, 25, U, S, land, drilling, rigs, used, In, words, 75, rigs, earning, money, Almost, 90, fleet, utilized, June, 2014,

The, future, meanwhile, could, improve, pretty, quickly, drillers, like, Exxon, start, ramp, In, fact, end, first, quarter, Helmerich, rig, utilization, 31, That, 24, improvement, one, quarter, Helmerich, industry, leading, share, efficient, demand, AC, rigs, quick, jump, surprising, But, mean, company, 4, yield, start, fall, investors, start, notice, improving, market, 
It, pretty, clear, I, think, Exxon, Helmerich, Payne, worth, close, look, dividend, investors, I, concerned, Target, Corporation, The, company, increasing, dividend, 49, dividend, robust, 4, 2, right, But, facing, fundamental, challenge, business, floundering, 
For, example, store, sales, increased, roughly, 2, 1, 2015, fell, 0, 5, 2016, The, 1, 5, drop, important, fourth, quarter, particularly, troubling, But, bigger, concern, Target, expecting, pain, get, worse, projecting, low, single, digit, store, sales, decline, 2017, The, big, problem, appears, fundamental, change, way, people, shop, notably, internet, Target, working, hard, grow, Target, e, commerce, revenue, growing, quickly, makes, small, portion, business, today,

In, end, I, believe, Exxon, Helmerich, Payne, leading, operators, industry, nearly, adjusted, new, normal, oil, prices, I, expect, survive, thrive, making, historically, high, yields, well, worth, risk, Target, however, appears, stumbling, time, deep, industry, change, Even, company, hinting, results, could, get, worse, get, better, making, dividend, champion, best, avoided,
