The, stock, market, getting, impatient, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Fellow, oil, majors, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, NYSE, RDS, B, Total, SA, NYSE, TOT, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, released, plans, sharply, reduce, 2020, capital, spending, wake, oil, price, crash, In, response, market, sent, shares, soaring, Over, week, March, 19, 25, share, prices, rose, 25, 8, Chevron, 68, 8, Shell, Class, A, Shares, Exxon, hand, saw, shares, rise, 12, period, 
Here, Exxon, risky, spot, could, cause, problems, dividend, 
EXXONMOBIL, HAS, RELIABLY, INCREASED, ITS, DIVIDEND, FOR, DECADES, COULD, THAT, TREND, BE, ABOUT, TO, END, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
Before, oil, prices, collapsed, early, March, oil, majors, planning, increase, capital, spending, 2020, 2019, levels, Exxon, struggled, recent, declining, production, particularly, keen, spend, Speaking, ExxonMobil, annual, investor, day, March, 5, CEO, Darren, Woods, announced, company, would, leaning, market, others, pulled, back, tune, 30, billion, 35, billion, annual, spending, That, almost, certainly, would, involved, outspending, company, cash, flow, times, 
Investors, think, much, idea, company, shares, fallen, 25, since, March, 5, On, March, 16, S, P, Global, downgraded, Exxon, credit, rating, AA, AA, still, investment, grade, signal, market, discomfort, prospect, rising, debt, Almost, immediately, Exxon, put, press, release, vowing, look, appropriate, steps, significantly, reduce, capital, operating, expenses, near, term, 
That, announcement, seemed, slow, pace, company, share, price, decline, But, week, later, Exxon, still, coy, exactly, cuts, plans, make, 
The, thing, going, reassure, market, concrete, plan, action, Exxon, oil, major, peers, set, bar, pretty, high, announcing, spending, cuts, around, 20, Shell, cutting, estimated, 8, billion, 9, billion, capital, operating, expenses, 2020, Chevron, similarly, promised, 5, billion, reduction, spending, Total, cutting, 800, million, In, addition, Shell, Chevron, suspended, share, buyback, programs, ate, billions, dollars, cash, flow, 2019, 
So, anything, less, 20, reduction, capital, spending, probably, seen, market, disappointment, likely, lead, share, price, decline, However, Woods, clearly, eager, follow, time, tested, Exxon, playbook, spending, money, throughout, cycle, regardless, oil, prices, That, winning, strategy, company, past, makes, uncertain, much, cutting, Woods, willing, In, likelihood, going, try, gauge, exactly, much, little, needs, cut, satisfy, market, announce, much, nothing, else, 
How, much, would, satisfy, market, Well, Exxon, spent, 31, 1, billion, capital, exploration, 2019, 20, increase, 2018, 25, 9, billion, So, 20, cut, would, roughly, 6, billion, 
Would, cutting, 6, billion, capital, budget, enough, secure, Exxon, dividend, 
The, company, paid, 14, 7, billion, dividends, 2019, Together, 31, 1, billion, capital, exploration, totaled, 45, 8, billion, However, company, brought, 29, 7, billion, operating, cash, flow, 16, 1, billion, less, two, expense, categories, It, made, difference, primarily, 3, 7, billion, asset, sales, 8, 7, billion, increase, net, debt, 
So, even, 6, billion, reduction, capital, expenditures, would, still, leave, Exxon, assuming, oil, prices, comparable, last, 10, billion, hole, fill, And, course, oil, prices, today, much, lower, time, 2019, means, hole, likely, much, larger, 10, billion, The, company, current, cash, hand, 3, 1, billion, much, help, 
However, Exxon, current, debt, load, 45, 3, billion, although, record, high, company, equates, less, 1, 1, times, EBITDA, low, end, peer, group, Chevron, debt, EBITDA, ratio, 0, 9, lower, Despite, recent, credit, downgrade, maintains, rating, Aaa, AA, still, high, The, company, would, likely, problem, securing, financing, maintain, dividend, 
Exxon, going, come, clean, specific, 2020, spending, plans, sooner, rather, later, If, comes, anything, less, 20, reduction, capital, spending, market, likely, punish, stock, On, hand, unlikely, event, company, surprises, say, spending, cut, 10, billion, 27, investors, probably, send, shares, upward, 
That, said, moves, placate, market, pay, short, term, may, best, long, term, strategy, Exxon, right, companies, general, 
Either, way, ExxonMobil, seems, likely, continue, maintain, status, Dividend, Aristocrat, provided, current, economic, situation, drag, many, If, ExxonMobil, oil, industry, general, bigger, problems, potential, dividend, cut, 
It, whirlwind, past, six, weeks, Wall, Street, Main, Street, Since, topping, Feb, 19, took, three, weeks, iconic, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, DJINDICES, DJI, dip, bear, market, territory, four, weeks, 123, old, index, shed, excess, 30, value, At, point, storied, history, ever, seen, 20, 30, drop, recent, high, materialize, quickly, 
As, likely, well, aware, spread, coronavirus, disease, 2019, COVID, 19, squarely, blame, Not, illness, claimed, 3, 000, American, lives, March, 30, stringent, mitigation, measures, put, place, number, major, cities, states, threatens, bring, economic, activity, halt, Over, next, couple, weeks, could, see, truly, jaw, droppingly, bad, economic, data, 
And, yet, amid, carnage, solace, knowing, brighter, days, ahead, No, matter, sort, economic, crisis, thrown, Dow, Jones, Industrial, Average, century, always, eventually, put, bear, markets, rearview, mirror, pushed, higher, The, key, course, investors, hang, onto, investments, long, run, take, part, bull, market, rallies, 
What, coronavirus, crash, done, make, number, Dow, 30, components, considerably, attractive, valuation, basis, In, fact, I, go, far, call, following, three, Dow, stocks, screaming, buys, 
First, payment, processing, giant, American, Express, NYSE, AXP, lost, much, half, value, Feb, 19, peak, March, 18, trough, AmEx, found, Wall, Street, crosshairs, two, reasons, First, liable, see, payment, processing, revenue, decline, people, hunker, homes, wait, spread, COVID, 19, Second, perhaps, worryingly, American, Express, also, lender, meaning, likely, see, credit, delinquencies, rise, given, lack, economic, activity, certain, rise, unemployment, rate, 
While, tangible, concerns, negative, impact, American, Express, payment, processing, peers, I, view, scenario, dire, made, Wall, Street, That, AmEx, primarily, seeks, affluent, clientele, credit, cards, Although, exclude, company, pain, rising, wave, credit, delinquencies, likely, going, less, disruption, AmEx, number, lenders, Affluent, individuals, likely, emergency, savings, therefore, less, likely, pay, bills, 
The, passage, record, 2, 2, trillion, CARES, Act, also, help, small, businesses, families, working, Americans, meet, obligations, It, certainly, long, term, solution, step, right, direction, 
Right, investors, buy, American, Express, less, 10, times, next, profit, potential, roughly, three, times, book, value, It, decade, since, could, buy, AmEx, single, digit, forward, P, E, ratio, nine, since, could, nab, stock, three, times, book, value, 
Perhaps, ugliest, sector, COVID, 19, crash, energy, integrated, oil, gas, company, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, taking, chin, Shares, ExxonMobil, close, 50, basis, West, Texas, Intermediate, WTI, crude, pushing, 20, per, barrel, That, lowest, mark, since, 2002, With, crude, demand, falling, floor, due, coronavirus, Saudi, Arabia, Russia, engaged, crude, pricing, war, near, term, looks, ugly, oil, stocks, 
But, couple, tricks, ExxonMobil, sleeve, even, environment, WTI, going, approximately, 20, barrel, One, thing, realize, fully, integrated, energy, company, Even, though, upstream, drilling, operations, provide, bulk, ExxonMobil, growth, opportunity, usually, able, benefit, weaker, crude, pricing, downstream, refining, petrochemical, operations, These, downstream, operations, come, especially, handy, later, assuming, global, economic, activity, picks, back, 
ExxonMobil, also, serious, levers, pull, cost, cutting, front, The, company, previously, pledged, spend, 30, billion, 33, billion, projects, 2020, obviously, looking, slash, outlay, billions, come, It, also, spent, nearly, 14, 7, billion, 2019, paying, dividend, While, I, get, ExxonMobil, Dividend, Aristocrat, likely, unwilling, sacrifice, payout, could, easily, conserve, cash, cutting, shelving, payout, 
Currently, near, 18, low, ExxonMobil, presents, incredible, value, long, term, minded, investors, look, beyond, COVID, 19, almost, certain, increase, demand, fossil, fuel, products, 
Lastly, money, center, bank, JPMorgan, Chase, NYSE, JPM, looking, particularly, attractive, shedding, third, value, six, week, swoon, 
Right, two, big, knocks, banks, First, cyclical, industry, pretty, much, everyone, Wall, Street, seems, convinced, headed, steep, hopefully, short, recession, Second, Federal, Reserve, lowered, federal, funds, rate, back, time, record, low, range, 0, 0, 25, Put, simply, means, net, interest, margins, banks, squeezed, leading, less, way, net, interest, income, 
But, JPMorgan, Chase, typical, bank, Among, largest, national, money, center, banks, consistently, vying, No, 1, No, 2, spot, terms, return, assets, This, means, better, banks, generating, profit, assets, 
At, time, JPMorgan, Chase, aggressively, pushing, new, markets, It, one, big, banks, opening, branches, closing, willingly, spending, technology, investments, designed, drive, digital, mobile, banking, As, reminder, digital, mobile, banking, lead, significantly, lower, transaction, costs, banks, person, even, phone, based, transactions,
