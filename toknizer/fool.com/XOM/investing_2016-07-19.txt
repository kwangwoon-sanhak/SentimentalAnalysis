No, one, disputes, Alaska, massive, natural, gas, reserves, Commercializing, bringing, gas, market, though, poses, unique, set, challenges, Primarily, get, gas, Alaska, North, Slope, Kenai, Peninsula, prepared, export, The, current, solution, build, 800, mile, long, natural, gas, pipeline, liquefaction, facility, via, partnership, comprised, state, Alaska, BP, NYSE, BP, ConocoPhillips, NYSE, COP, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Alaska, Governor, Bill, Walker, citing, waning, support, project, three, oil, producing, partners, recently, proposed, state, possible, backing, international, institutional, investors, take, sole, ownership, pipeline, project, If, investor, three, companies, alarmed, news, Here, 
The, project, monumental, undertaking, Current, projections, put, price, tag, estimated, 45, billion, 65, billion, The, whole, project, include, 800, mile, long, 42, inch, diameter, pipeline, liquefaction, facility, Kenai, Peninsula, eight, compression, stations, five, takeoff, points, state, delivery, North, Slope, gas, treatment, plant, transmission, lines, linking, Prudhoe, Bay, Point, Thomson, fields, gas, treatment, plant, 
BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, agreed, project, hold, largest, natural, gas, assets, North, Slope, would, like, get, gas, market, Alaska, reeling, downturn, oil, prices, sees, project, major, cash, infusion, economy, 
In, December, last, partnership, agreed, provide, requisite, 230, million, fund, planned, development, permitting, 2016, While, serious, cash, pales, comparison, nearly, 2, billion, required, planned, 2017, activities, This, three, oil, companies, beginning, bristle, Alaska, preparing, step, 
Again, one, challenging, production, potential, natural, gas, Alaska, Estimates, put, Point, Thomson, Prudhoe, Bay, natural, gas, reserves, around, 34, trillion, cubic, feet, Most, gas, currently, extracted, actually, reinserted, ground, stabilize, pressure, oil, production, Oil, gas, producers, would, prefer, bring, gas, market, rather, reinject, ground, 
In, May, ExxonMobil, began, tap, potential, beginning, production, hopes, become, 10, 000, barrels, natural, gas, condensates, per, day, After, spending, 4, billion, develop, field, though, company, hopes, significantly, expand, natural, gas, production, depend, price, natural, gas, ability, transport, terminal, export, 
And, key, three, companies, For, pipeline, project, move, forward, costlier, 2017, phase, three, oil, producing, partners, indicated, oil, natural, gas, prices, need, climb, higher, The, specific, number, unclear, lack, volatility, persistently, high, prices, almost, certainly, required, companies, feel, comfortable, investing, tens, billions, 2025, pipeline, would, theoretically, begin, transporting, natural, gas, 
Unfortunately, number, potential, issues, Alaska, proposed, plan, become, sole, owner, pipeline, The, Walker, administration, believes, might, able, rely, third, party, partners, required, investment, far, certainty, By, relying, large, oil, companies, Alaska, found, partners, vested, interests, developing, infrastructure, transport, gas, lowest, possible, cost, International, private, investors, Walker, mentions, Asian, utilities, pension, funds, need, financial, incentive, invest, via, either, guaranteed, natural, gas, deliveries, respective, countries, profits, transporting, natural, gas, would, cut, future, profits, oil, gas, companies, 
Without, digging, much, deeper, whether, country, invest, pipeline, leads, back, economics, producing, natural, gas, first, place, It, far, reach, say, oil, companies, would, begun, producing, North, Slope, natural, gas, fields, good, business, By, acknowledging, volatility, natural, gas, prices, decision, pursue, pipelines, companies, tacitly, acknowledging, might, make, sense, pursue, opportunities, 
To, sure, flip, side, coin, The, oil, companies, actually, suggested, Alaska, take, larger, role, project, would, enable, avoid, paying, billions, pipeline, giving, outlet, future, natural, gas, production, Oil, gas, companies, utilize, independent, pipelines, across, country, proven, business, model, The, difference, size, potential, third, party, investment, could, reach, higher, 50, billion, state, government, instead, oil, gas, companies, successfully, complete, pipeline, 
As, investors, really, need, consider, breakeven, point, Does, Alaska, ownership, lower, breakeven, point, BP, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, thereby, making, natural, gas, production, viable, Or, need, investors, recoup, massive, investment, presumably, interest, raise, prices, beyond, fixed, fee, rates, independent, pipelines, thereby, making, natural, gas, production, Alaska, less, viable, The, number, unknown, factors, potential, investors, price, natural, gas, agreed, upon, price, gas, transport, make, truly, difficult, question, answer, 
BP, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, remain, partners, project, today, continue, weigh, options, There, doubt, want, tap, potential, bringing, Alaskan, natural, gas, open, market, A, lot, obstacles, stand, way, though, Alaska, proposal, take, ownership, pipeline, project, adds, another, Alaska, potential, third, party, investors, could, cut, profits, thereby, making, natural, gas, production, even, less, economical, assuming, state, find, investors, begin, This, makes, strong, possibility, Alaskan, LNG, pipeline, go, unfinished, severely, underutilized, definition, phrase, would, make, pipeline, nowhere,
