Oil, natural, gas, prices, sitting, lower, half, 10, ranges, causing, lot, pain, exploration, space, And, yet, energy, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, continues, spend, huge, sums, expand, production, In, fact, company, recently, called, explorer, industry, watcher, Exxon, new, finds, outpaced, peers, second, running, Here, good, thing, even, though, oil, gas, prices, doldrums, 
Exxon, oil, equivalent, production, fell, 1, 2016, Production, declined, even, worse, 1, 7, following, And, trend, worsened, 2018, output, 2, 6, Continually, producing, less, less, oil, something, go, long, oil, company, Investors, rightly, spooked, numbers, 
This, backdrop, helps, explain, company, decided, undertake, aggressive, investment, plan, 2018, The, goal, basically, reverse, company, weak, production, trends, Early, results, shown, promise, 2019, production, appearing, something, turning, point, The, investments, company, made, desired, effect, Only, Exxon, spending, much, 35, billion, 2025, still, early, process, 
The, interesting, thing, Exxon, working, long, short, side, business, The, upturn, production, largely, driven, company, efforts, onshore, U, S, oil, space, Wells, region, tend, quick, drill, almost, immediate, impact, production, relatively, speaking, That, driving, company, 2019, production, results, 
Exxon, also, working, offshore, oil, projects, take, much, longer, develop, It, company, efforts, side, growth, plan, led, explorer, designation, In, onshore, U, S, space, companies, pretty, much, know, wells, drill, produce, oil, In, offshore, arena, companies, lot, exploration, work, pray, find, oil, end, day, Over, last, two, Exxon, finding, lot, oil, offshore, arena, 
But, company, offshore, production, efforts, starting, turn, oil, producing, wells, takes, longer, get, assets, running, So, exploration, success, Exxon, achieved, really, still, harbinger, better, production, results, ahead, That, good, news, come, company, works, 2025, spending, plans, 
The, bad, news, Exxon, production, ramping, time, oil, prices, low, Astute, long, term, investors, wondering, Exxon, game, plan, perhaps, little, flawed, If, oil, prices, stay, low, Exxon, indeed, getting, bigger, wrong, time, Luckily, story, meets, eye, 
Oil, wells, eventually, run, oil, often, fairly, quickly, For, example, shale, well, production, high, first, within, fall, much, 75, Offshore, wells, tend, high, production, rates, three, five, often, start, slow, point, You, need, find, new, oil, replace, declining, wells, production, keep, shrinking, So, Exxon, least, making, sure, business, keep, getting, smaller, However, another, side, tale, While, world, leaning, toward, cleaner, energy, sources, makes, ESG, investors, happy, still, long, way, go, world, simply, divorce, oil, natural, gas, Exxon, produces, 
XOM, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Energy, companies, trying, explain, Exxon, example, highlighted, takes, huge, investments, time, money, shift, one, energy, source, another, oil, rise, top, lasting, roughy, 100, Peer, Royal, Dutch, Shell, noted, oil, natural, gas, still, high, demand, despite, negative, images, And, Chevron, explained, world, growth, means, energy, types, needed, one, option, example, clean, energy, enough, satisfy, demand, In, words, industry, giants, even, close, correct, Exxon, crazy, focusing, production, growth, oil, industry, still, plenty, life, ahead, 
That, said, supply, high, today, likely, change, near, term, But, positive, well, Exxon, basically, working, counter, cyclically, putting, money, work, downturn, able, get, bang, buck, better, positioned, prices, eventually, recover, And, since, oil, commodity, supply, demand, likely, even, point, For, example, rash, bankruptcies, onshore, U, S, drilling, space, could, likely, time, lead, rational, production, region, blamed, capping, oil, price, recovery, It, smooth, ride, course, But, Exxon, one, strongest, balance, sheets, industry, handle, ups, downs, still, investing, future, 
Exxon, betting, 2025, oil, natural, gas, prices, stronger, today, That, spending, heavily, right, earning, explorer, designation, While, may, seem, like, questionable, news, face, relatively, low, oil, prices, Exxon, peers, right, future, investors, buy, Exxon, today, well, rewarded, oil, prices, eventually, recover, Until, meanwhile, investors, willing, bet, Exxon, right, collect, fat, 5, yield, backed, one, strongest, companies, energy, space, This, sounds, like, pretty, good, risk, reward, trade, dividend, focused, investors,
