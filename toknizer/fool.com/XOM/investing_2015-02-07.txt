One, industry, waste, another, industry, treasure, While, United, States, home, cheapest, natural, gas, reserves, world, lacks, infrastructure, needed, fully, process, components, natural, gas, Hydrocarbons, ethane, cannot, used, gas, fired, power, plants, chemical, facilities, end, pipeline, instead, typically, burned, Not, wasteful, environmental, standpoint, creates, inefficiencies, economical, standpoint, sapping, potential, revenue, streams, drillers, 
That, point, illustrated, fact, United, States, produces, 300, 000, barrels, per, day, ethane, cannot, use, Luckily, companies, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Dow, Chemical, NYSE, DOW, raced, provide, solutions, building, expanding, dozens, domestic, petrochemical, facilities, represent, industrywide, investment, 124, billion, according, American, Chemistry, Council, These, petrochemical, plants, called, ethane, crackers, convert, excess, ethane, ethylene, starting, point, higher, value, fibers, plastics, detergents, various, everyday, products, low, costs, even, OPEC, induced, oil, pricing, war, challenge, economics,

In, late, 2010, Braskem, opened, production, facility, converts, 122, million, gallons, Brazilian, sugarcane, ethanol, 200, 000, metric, tons, ethylene, It, first, world, capable, churning, renewable, ethylene, avoids, 4, metric, tons, carbon, dioxide, emissions, every, 1, MT, product, At, capital, cost, 278, million, facility, relatively, cheap, build, uncommon, feature, first, kind, facility, It, important, note, product, exactly, ethylene, created, petrochemicals, Those, factors, helped, Braskem, sell, roughly, 80, facility, production, environmentally, conscious, consumer, facing, companies, Procter, Gamble, Johnson, Johnson, construction, even, began,

American, ethane, cheap, Sasol, company, perfected, gas, liquids, technology, decided, cancel, 11, billion, gas, liquids, facility, Louisiana, instead, 7, billion, ethane, cracker, Dow, Chemical, expects, add, nearly, 2, billion, annual, EBITDA, ethane, crackers, running, full, capacity, give, company, access, cheaper, ethylene, produced, house, performance, plastics, products, Meanwhile, ExxonMobil, estimates, increased, chemical, investments, create, 600, 000, American, jobs, 250, billion, economic, output, within, decade, operations, 
Given, optimism, size, investments, American, ethane, renewable, ethylene, created, ethanol, chance, competing, global, scale, 
How, low, go, 
Chemical, manufacturing, game, cheapest, feedstock, wins, And, comes, ethylene, production, world, two, options, 1, ethane, ethylene, 2, naphtha, ethylene, That, said, American, ethane, natural, gas, handily, beats, naphtha, derived, crude, oil, nearly, anywhere, world, The, severe, cost, disadvantage, facing, naphtha, ethylene, production, Europe, Japan, remains, place, despite, falling, oil, prices, driven, industry, 124, billion, investments, ethane, crackers, 
As, probably, guess, ethanol, renewable, ethylene, also, difficult, time, competing, American, ethane, anytime, soon, Using, current, market, prices, ethanol, ethane, production, Braskem, renewable, ethylene, facility, roughly, 200, 300, expensive, would, production, petrochemical, plant, Dow, Chemical, expects, bring, online, 2017, Sure, Braskem, facility, many, times, cheaper, build, capital, cost, advantages, washed, long, term, Besides, ethane, necessarily, competition, ethanol, 
Consider, Braskem, ethanol, renewable, ethylene, process, already, competitive, established, naphtha, ethylene, processes, certain, markets, access, cheap, ethanol, Europe, China, The, economics, become, persuasive, oil, prices, inevitably, rise, ahead, That, could, encourage, foreign, chemical, manufacturers, invest, renewable, ethylene, production, relying, domestic, feedstocks, instead, imports, America, Should, Europe, China, build, enough, capacity, American, chemical, plants, could, lose, valuable, export, markets, already, penciled, earnings, growth, projections, 
It, also, worth, noting, American, ethane, eventually, valued, higher, current, near, zero, levels, When, ethane, crackers, come, online, 2017, begin, gobbling, excess, ethane, new, ethane, pipelines, Canada, ethane, export, terminals, along, Gulf, Coast, That, combination, infrastructure, solutions, force, ethane, markets, behave, well, real, markets, competition, supply, In, words, ethane, prices, rise, 
THE, WORLD, S, FIRST, RENEWABLE, ETHYLENE, FACILITY, IMAGE, SOURCE, BRASKEM, 
But, even, ethanol, maintains, 10, average, price, roughly, 2, 25, per, gallon, compared, 1, 40, today, ethane, rises, 0, 40, per, pound, compared, 0, 10, today, renewable, ethylene, still, cost, competitive, ethane, crackers, However, presenting, global, ethanol, producers, alternative, higher, value, market, transportation, fuels, could, shift, economics, unpredictable, ways, For, instance, rather, idling, production, due, constraints, fuel, markets, American, ethanol, capacity, could, operate, full, steam, ahead, eye, toward, renewable, chemical, production, Throw, another, record, corn, harvest, pushes, corn, prices, ethanol, production, costs, multiyear, lows, economics, renewable, ethylene, sound, crazy, even, compared, ethane, 
What, mean, investors, 
Diversification, good, thing, even, large, established, industries, natural, gas, chemical, manufacturing, Companies, ExxonMobil, Dow, Chemical, investing, billions, dollars, leverage, cheap, American, ethane, create, global, alternative, higher, priced, naphtha, ethylene, production, The, economics, almost, good, true, make, difficult, impossible, naphtha, compete, head, head, That, alone, protect, earnings, power, world, class, ethane, crackers, built, along, Gulf, Coast, along, proposed, facilities, Appalachians, Go, ahead, take, deep, breath, 
While, investors, cheer, growth, enabling, ethane, crackers, must, also, acknowledge, ethanol, renewable, ethylene, production, provides, realistic, economical, manufacturing, option, With, 200, 000, MT, annual, production, globally, today, remains, distant, threat, But, Braskem, could, expand, markets, currently, relying, expensive, naphtha, access, cheap, ethanol, Europe, China, In, long, term, could, chip, away, customer, base, export, markets, American, ethane, crackers, although, industry, 124, billion, investments, safe, 
However, ethylene, market, plays, two, things, likely, true, Naphtha, ethylene, may, going, way, dodo, And, world, complicated, relationship, ethanol, get, bit, complicated,
