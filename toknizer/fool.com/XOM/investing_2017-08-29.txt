Unprecedented, rains, flooding, deadly, Hurricane, Harvey, hit, number, Texas, cities, including, Houston, Corpus, Christi, weekend, still, occurring, The, extent, damage, yet, unknown, expected, run, tens, billions, dollars, 
Obviously, storm, effects, stock, market, far, less, concern, impact, victims, investors, financial, worries, pale, comparison, tremendous, losses, many, people, Texas, suffering, right, But, Harvey, moves, area, important, investors, prepared, find, portfolios, cleanup, begins, 
Let, look, storm, impact, big, Texas, based, oil, companies, like, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, ConocoPhillips, HollyFrontier, NYSE, HFC, Apache, Corporation, NASDAQ, APA, Anadarko, Petroleum, NYSE, APC, 
HURRICANE, HARVEY, HAS, FLOODED, THE, HOUSTON, AREA, DISRUPTING, THE, OIL, AND, GAS, INDUSTRY, LUCKILY, THESE, DISRUPTIONS, ARE, LIKELY, TO, BE, SHORT, LIVED, IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
As, Harvey, approached, Gulf, Coast, companies, forced, take, immediate, preventative, measures, These, included, shutting, refineries, Texas, Gulf, Coast, 25, nation, refining, capacity, located, 
ExxonMobil, shut, Baytown, refinery, Houston, second, largest, refinery, country, processes, 560, 000, barrels, oil, per, day, Other, major, refineries, like, Marathon, Petroleum, NYSE, MPC, Galveston, Bay, refinery, 460, 000, barrels, day, operating, reduced, capacity, floodwaters, unsafe, conditions, prevented, employees, reaching, work, Overall, Harvey, knocked, 10, country, refining, capacity, 
Besides, refineries, many, offshore, oil, platforms, Gulf, Mexico, evacuated, ensure, worker, safety, shut, due, pipeline, issues, Anadarko, example, evacuate, four, 10, Gulf, platforms, shut, four, As, Friday, U, S, Bureau, Safety, Environmental, Enforcement, said, workers, removed, 86, 737, manned, oil, gas, platforms, Gulf, Onshore, operations, also, affected, ConocoPhillips, ceased, operations, inland, Eagle, Ford, Shale, 
The, storm, concern, industrial, facilities, Companies, whose, headquarters, located, near, Houston, forced, close, administrative, offices, due, flooding, Apache, announced, Houston, office, would, closed, Monday, would, provide, regular, updates, Although, Anadarko, headquarters, The, Woodlands, north, Houston, significantly, damaged, storm, according, company, press, release, Anadarko, shutting, offices, notice, response, flooding, Shares, companies, dropped, response, 
It, may, days, weeks, case, hard, hit, refineries, even, longer, inspections, cleanup, occur, normal, operations, resume, But, good, news, almost, certainly, resume, disruptions, stock, price, temporary, 
Much, coverage, Harvey, impact, oil, gas, industry, focused, rise, gasoline, prices, storm, caused, Estimates, ranged, 0, 05, gallon, increase, 0, 25, gallon, You, might, think, would, good, news, oil, companies, But, complicated, 
You, see, higher, gas, prices, caused, spike, crude, oil, prices, In, fact, oil, prices, especially, West, Texas, Intermediate, dropped, last, week, Harvey, approached, That, means, companies, exclusively, produce, oil, like, ConocoPhillips, Apache, Anadarko, seeing, benefit, 
The, primary, beneficiaries, actually, oil, refiners, That, might, seem, counterintuitive, considering, refineries, shut, due, storm, But, refiners, make, money, known, crack, spread, difference, price, unrefined, crude, oil, price, refined, products, like, gasoline, With, price, oil, gas, prices, crack, spread, increases, means, big, payday, refiners, 
Already, Marathon, Petroleum, despite, reduced, capacity, Galveston, Bay, seen, stock, rise, 5, since, Aug, 22, Shares, HollyFrontier, operates, five, refineries, none, anywhere, near, Gulf, Mexico, risen, 15, time, 
Big, integrated, majors, like, ExxonMobil, unlikely, see, substantial, effect, storm, Because, big, international, companies, U, S, refining, accounts, tiny, fraction, overall, revenue, Exxon, example, derived, less, 10, 2017, earnings, far, overall, U, S, downstream, activities, includes, refining, 
Likewise, pipeline, operators, may, see, small, benefit, business, refinery, shutdowns, require, oil, gas, piped, longer, distances, Because, pipeline, operators, generally, use, toll, booth, pricing, model, longer, distances, translate, higher, revenue, Most, pipeline, companies, integrated, majors, seen, stock, gains, 1, 4, since, Aug, 22, 
But, important, thing, know, changes, likely, temporary, 
As, big, disaster, Hurricane, Harvey, seems, likely, important, investors, make, hasty, buy, sell, decisions, response, The, reactions, past, disasters, shows, effects, stock, prices, tend, temporary, 
After, Hurricane, Katrina, August, 2005, example, stocks, companies, like, ExxonMobil, Apache, Anadarko, spiked, But, mid, October, three, dropped, pre, Katrina, levels, June, 2001, Tropical, Storm, Allison, like, Harvey, flooded, Houston, similarly, short, lived, effects, 
The, bottom, line, Keep, cool, head, base, buying, selling, decisions, stocks, fundamentals, opposed, news, headlines, Remember, investing, long, term, even, major, natural, disasters, tend, short, lived, effects, market, That, said, disaster, drives, cheap, stock, bargain, territory, may, compelling, reason, pick, shares,
