Last, United, States, became, net, exporter, natural, gas, first, time, since, 1957, Although, 77, exports, traveled, pipelines, 98, 2012, The, rest, came, liquefied, natural, gas, LNG, shipped, specialized, ocean, tankers, The, nation, exited, 2017, three, LNG, export, terminals, boasting, combined, capacity, 3, billion, cubic, feet, per, day, Bcf, That, pretty, big, number, seem, laughably, small, decade, 
If, investors, add, LNG, export, facilities, approved, 12, including, three, operating, proposed, 14, American, energy, regulators, arrive, combined, LNG, export, capacity, 44, 2, Bcf, Some, may, never, get, built, Those, may, enter, service, another, decade, Either, way, shows, incredible, potential, fledgling, American, LNG, industry, 
I, understand, 44, 2, Bcf, almost, large, make, sense, investors, looking, gain, foothold, coming, industry, feel, overwhelmed, Here, five, LNG, export, projects, energy, investors, know, 
Cheniere, Energy, NYSEMKT, LNG, first, company, make, bold, bet, potential, United, States, export, large, volumes, excess, natural, gas, It, risky, paid, spades, The, business, posted, 3, 8, billion, revenue, 1, billion, operating, income, first, half, 2018, single, albeit, massive, facility, 
In, 2016, Sabine, Pass, became, first, new, major, LNG, export, terminal, country, It, wields, capacity, 2, 8, Bcf, although, approved, expansion, projects, add, 1, 4, Bcf, No, approved, proposed, facility, matches, combined, volume, list, projects, expected, come, line, end, 2019, includes, monsters, dotting, Gulf, Coast, That, includes, Corpus, Christi, second, facility, Cheniere, Energy,

That, case, five, projects, table, For, instance, Sempra, Energy, owns, 50, 2, stake, Cameron, LNG, project, expected, bring, three, production, units, called, trains, industry, lingo, line, 2019, The, first, two, originally, expected, come, line, delayed, It, matter, much, ramped, Cameron, LNG, expected, export, 8, 6, billion, LNG, plus, another, 2, 2, billion, natural, gas, liquids, crude, oil, And, include, two, production, units, already, approved, Federal, Energy, Regulatory, Commission, FERC, 
Not, wanting, get, complacent, early, lead, Cheniere, Energy, expanding, existing, Sabine, Pass, four, production, units, already, service, A, fifth, train, expected, start, commerical, operations, second, quarter, 2019, Construction, yet, begin, sixth, train, although, received, regulatory, approval, Meanwhile, first, two, trains, Corpus, Christi, expected, start, first, half, 2019, third, begin, construction,

Last, least, Golden, Pass, export, terminal, proposed, ExxonMobil, majority, owner, ConocoPhillips, Qatar, Petroleum, While, final, investment, decision, made, project, may, able, come, line, little, quicker, That, converting, existing, import, terminal, send, gas, direction, similar, Cheniere, Energy, Sabine, Pass, facility, means, good, chunk, existing, pipeline, port, infrastructure, already, place, Another, potential, catalyst, located, Sabine, Pass, Texas, home, lot, LNG, process, know, infrastructure, something, discounted, early, goings, industry, 
While, five, LNG, export, terminals, discussed, get, party, started, America, soon, dominance, global, energy, markets, handful, projects, coming, pipeline, Some, test, newer, technology, smaller, faster, liquefaction, trains, project, sponsors, say, provide, industry, leading, economics, Some, sport, new, business, models, partly, response, shifting, market, dynamics, pioneers, avoided, locking, long, term, contracts, The, main, takeaway, simple, Energy, investors, get, familiar, LNG, industry, stay, 
Chasing, yield, dangerous, pursuit, income, loving, investors, dangerous, dividend, paying, stocks, sport, high, yields, Better, look, stocks, also, enjoy, bit, capital, appreciation, businesses, solid, enough, support, dividend, perhaps, even, grow, time,
