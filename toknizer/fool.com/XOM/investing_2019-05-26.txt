Exxon, Shell, operate, upstream, oil, natural, gas, drilling, midstream, pipeline, downstream, refining, chemicals, business, This, vertical, integration, provides, balance, revenues, earnings, downstream, operations, usually, get, boost, low, energy, prices, right, upstream, suffering, It, perfect, offset, oil, prices, still, dominant, driver, financial, results, companies, However, diversification, provide, balance, pure, driller, would, offer, 
Both, companies, large, well, Exxon, bigger, company, market, cap, roughly, 320, billion, However, Shell, far, behind, 280, billion, Although, size, alone, make, company, good, bad, provide, two, scale, take, huge, projects, smaller, companies, might, struggle, That, scale, meanwhile, built, long, time, Exxon, Shell, existence, form, 100, That, notable, managed, many, ups, downs, historically, volatile, oil, industry, 
These, two, industry, giants, also, fairly, strong, balance, sheets, That, said, take, notably, different, approaches, managing, financial, statement, Specifically, Exxon, tends, make, modest, use, long, term, debt, accounts, 10, capital, structure, today, Shell, long, term, debt, little, 30, capital, structure, That, gives, Exxon, flexibility, add, long, term, debt, industry, downturn, support, capital, investing, plans, dividends, However, Shell, tends, carry, lot, cash, balance, sheet, 21, billion, Exxon, 4, 5, billion, Taking, consideration, Shell, balance, sheet, looks, much, stronger, 
That, said, differing, balance, sheet, approaches, clear, display, deep, oil, downturn, started, mid, 2014, Shell, chose, stop, raising, dividend, rough, patch, yet, start, Exxon, increased, dividend, right, downturn, boosted, 36, consecutive, It, stands, atop, integrated, energy, peer, group, comes, consistently, rewarding, investors, regular, dividend, hikes, If, consistent, dividend, growth, important, Exxon, easy, choice, Its, conservative, financial, policies, able, keep, upping, payout, even, hard, times,

Exxon, however, currently, midst, massive, investment, cycle, This, push, spurred, declining, trend, company, production, metrics, It, looks, like, company, turned, corner, production, start, growing, least, remain, stable, But, bigger, takeaway, comparing, Exxon, Shell, Exxon, basically, doubling, oil, natural, gas, space, 
By, comparison, Shell, actively, looking, spread, bets, new, areas, It, purposefully, taken, broad, view, energy, industry, includes, electricity, future, plans, Specifically, dabbling, renewable, power, space, This, still, small, part, Shell, business, oil, giant, pushing, new, areas, But, major, point, differentiation, Exxon, If, looking, broadly, diversified, energy, company, Shell, move, extend, reach, electric, markets, clearly, appealing, This, nascent, effort, however, potentially, increases, chance, misstep, since, electricity, company, main, business, 
When, step, back, Exxon, Shell, look, big, picture, good, companies, Each, financially, strong, providing, investors, material, return, investment, via, dividends, Oil, natural, gas, also, main, factor, driving, company, business, many, come, Neither, bad, option,
