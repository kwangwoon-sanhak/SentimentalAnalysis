The, global, oil, market, state, disarray, thanks, multiple, factors, notably, impact, COVID, 19, That, sent, energy, sector, reeling, bankruptcies, spending, cuts, cost, containment, efforts, viable, avenues, companies, looking, get, historically, difficult, period, Material, dividend, cuts, also, starting, take, shape, companies, like, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, B, Equinor, long, histories, reliably, returning, cash, investors, 
It, logical, question, whether, peers, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, forced, Here, key, things, consider, 
The, first, important, thing, remember, dividend, decisions, part, entirely, board, directors, The, management, team, clearly, provides, guidance, matter, whether, pay, dividend, much, pay, discretion, board, 
IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
This, good, bad, fact, However, clear, statements, made, via, dividend, decisions, For, example, Exxon, increased, dividend, annually, 37, consecutive, Chevron, annual, streak, far, behind, 33, There, multiple, ups, downs, historically, cyclical, energy, sector, last, three, decades, Clearly, paying, consistent, growing, dividend, important, boards, integrated, energy, giants, 
Don, assume, however, boards, Exxon, Chevron, make, hard, call, cut, dividends, need, The, current, headwinds, intense, led, many, energy, companies, trim, dividends, Shell, Equinor, two, direct, competitors, taken, drastic, step, ensure, ample, cash, survive, 
But, even, better, example, could, energy, services, company, Helmerich, Payne, NYSE, HP, This, company, streak, 47, annual, dividend, hikes, belt, still, felt, necessary, cut, dividend, March, 
What, interesting, cut, Helmerich, Payne, rock, solid, balance, sheet, Long, term, debt, made, 12, company, capital, structure, end, first, quarter, That, would, low, company, industry, This, decision, hard, one, driven, need, maintain, capital, spending, plans, capital, intensive, business, even, though, revenue, pressure, That, sound, pretty, similar, going, Helmerich, Payne, customers, list, includes, names, like, Exxon, Chevron, 
That, last, point, important, top, bottom, lines, Exxon, Chevron, clearly, driven, price, oil, There, excess, supply, coming, thanks, decades, worth, expansion, U, S, onshore, production, That, oversupply, situation, exacerbated, price, war, OPEC, Russia, since, resolved, But, real, hit, global, economic, shutdown, COVID, 19, led, swift, decline, demand, With, much, oil, little, demand, oil, prices, plummeted, historic, lows, 
Although, world, starting, reopen, glut, oil, sitting, storage, need, worked, And, supply, side, contracting, quickly, particularly, U, S, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, notes, rig, count, lowest, point, record, material, increase, oil, prices, likely, take, time, materialize, That, good, news, Exxon, Chevron, since, earnings, could, remain, pressure, long, time, 
That, said, dividends, paid, cash, flow, earnings, It, important, difference, earnings, includes, items, impact, cash, flow, like, depreciation, And, companies, generate, cash, outside, earnings, For, example, Chevron, Exxon, selling, assets, recent, That, results, cash, used, however, companies, want, including, investing, businesses, supporting, dividends, Although, selling, assets, current, market, environment, likely, easy, key, takeaway, Exxon, Chevron, support, dividends, ways, In, fact, support, dividends, ways, since, neither, earning, enough, cover, dividend, right, 
One, ways, company, get, cash, pay, things, issue, debt, That, exactly, Chevron, Exxon, done, At, end, first, quarter, Chevron, total, long, term, debt, increased, roughly, 20, start, Exxon, long, term, debt, jumped, even, rising, nearly, third, The, boards, two, companies, clearly, making, call, lean, balance, sheet, maintain, capital, spending, plans, reduced, levels, dividends, higher, levels, expectation, oil, prices, recover, This, cyclical, business, history, suggests, prices, eventually, turn, higher, 
XOM, TOTAL, LONG, TERM, DEBT, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
There, important, distinction, Exxon, Chevron, one, hand, Shell, Equinor, Shell, Equinor, historically, operated, leverage, offsetting, risk, sizable, cash, balances, That, typical, European, energy, companies, Exxon, Chevron, historically, done, exact, opposite, focusing, low, leverage, modest, levels, cash, These, equivalent, options, current, situation, shows, High, levels, leverage, limit, financial, flexibility, tough, times, increasing, leverage, even, downturn, desirable, move, And, times, stress, burning, cash, equally, problematic, Thus, Shell, Equinor, chose, preserve, cash, cutting, dividends, Starting, much, lower, leverage, Exxon, Chevron, balance, sheet, flexibility, using, protect, dividends, In, fact, even, increases, leverage, two, oil, giants, still, remain, low, end, peer, group, 
While, boards, Exxon, Chevron, clearly, making, decision, support, businesses, dividends, today, using, balance, sheet, strength, go, long, If, oil, prices, recover, point, dividends, eventually, get, cut, However, would, likely, mean, structural, change, global, energy, demand, That, something, Exxon, Chevron, think, horizon, right, focusing, long, term, supply, demand, dynamics, suggest, oil, natural, gas, remain, vital, world, many, come, 
Still, investor, need, watch, big, picture, Exxon, Chevron, made, clear, first, quarter, conference, calls, plan, support, dividends, dip, ample, capacity, But, dip, turns, something, forced, change, plans, 
There, guarantees, comes, investing, accept, certain, amount, uncertainty, When, comes, investing, Exxon, Chevron, today, legitimate, concerns, abilities, keep, paying, dividends, supporting, 7, 5, 5, 5, yields, respectively, In, near, term, looks, like, financial, capacity, support, dividends, historically, difficult, energy, market, That, likely, change, quarter, two, 
However, dividend, investors, keeping, close, eye, two, integrated, energy, giants, say, If, either, starts, suggesting, fundamental, change, industry, probably, begin, worry,
