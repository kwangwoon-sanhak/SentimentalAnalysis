You, far, truth, think, choice, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, Corporation, NYSE, CVX, kind, like, flipping, coin, But, important, though, perhaps, small, differences, two, oil, giants, make, big, difference, one, actually, choose, Here, need, know, figure, one, better, buy, ExxonMobil, Corporation, Chevron, Corporation, 
One, main, reasons, look, Exxon, Chevron, dividend, income, Right, Exxon, offers, yield, around, 4, 2, Chevron, yield, closer, 3, 9, That, reversal, typical, pattern, For, last, 20, Chevron, yielded, Exxon, That, said, looking, maximize, current, income, Exxon, clearly, wins, 
Chevron, yield, spiked, around, current, level, three, times, past, two, decades, generally, lower, today, The, yield, looks, fairly, generous, historically, Exxon, meanwhile, seen, yield, high, since, late, 1990s, Using, yield, rough, estimate, valuation, Exxon, looks, particularly, cheap, yield, generous, historical, standards, For, yield, seekers, Exxon, better, option, even, difference, simply, basis, points, 
Exxon, increased, dividend, 36, consecutive, Chevron, increased, dividend, 31, Exxon, winner, much, However, deeper, story, During, deep, oil, downturn, started, mid, 2014, Chevron, held, dividend, constant, 10, consecutive, quarters, That, two, half, without, dividend, increase, long, time, investors, wait, worry, industry, soft, patch, The, reason, annual, streak, remained, alive, mid, timing, dividend, hikes,

DATA, SOURCE, COMPANY, WEBSITES, 
Exxon, hand, increased, dividend, every, downturn, Those, regular, dividend, hikes, provided, statement, shareholders, management, still, upbeat, view, future, So, big, picture, similar, Exxon, gets, nod, dividend, history, well, To, fair, lot, major, oil, companies, paused, like, Chevron, time, period, makes, Exxon, commitment, rewarding, shareholders, regular, dividend, increases, much, notable, 
Over, past, decade, annualized, growth, Chevron, dividend, 6, 7, That, roughly, twice, historical, rate, inflation, growth, A, solid, number, investors, look, upon, favorably, However, Exxon, dividend, grew, annualized, 8, 4, period, In, fact, Exxon, annualized, dividend, growth, higher, trailing, one, three, five, 10, periods, The, difference, one, periods, huge, time, Exxon, clearly, rewarded, investors, larger, increases, That, another, win, Exxon, 
CVX, DIVIDEND, PER, SHARE, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
The, balance, sheet, another, important, factor, examine, look, dividend, paying, stock, Too, much, debt, makes, hard, support, dividend, Chevron, long, term, debt, makes, around, 16, capital, structure, That, low, level, leverage, company, suggests, Chevron, strong, financially, Even, worst, downturn, started, mid, 2014, oil, giants, across, board, using, balance, sheets, muddle, rough, patch, Chevron, long, term, debt, rose, 20, capital, structure, 
While, Chevron, leverage, stats, look, impressive, story, even, better, Exxon, Exxon, long, term, debt, roughly, 10, capital, structure, today, And, worst, rose, around, 15, It, also, worth, noting, Chevron, Exxon, toward, low, end, peer, group, comes, leverage, However, Exxon, wins, even, though, balance, sheets, companies, strong, today, remained, strong, downturn, started, mid, 2014, 
Being, able, sustain, growing, dividend, requires, growth, long, term, And, score, Chevron, better, job, lately, The, company, production, fell, 1, 2016, period, oil, majors, pulling, back, spending, However, rose, 5, 2017, production, growth, continued, first, nine, 2018, Exxon, production, fell, 1, 2016, another, 1, 7, 2017, Worse, Exxon, production, continued, decline, first, nine, 2018, This, one, main, reasons, Exxon, yield, high, historically, relative, Chevron, 
That, said, two, different, plans, future, Exxon, ramping, exploration, budget, big, projects, planned, U, S, onshore, space, offshore, natural, gas, It, expects, spending, get, production, growth, back, track, Early, results, suggest, success, production, growing, sequentially, second, third, quarters, 2018, The, driving, force, shift, onshore, U, S, drilling, activity, one, company, big, drilling, projects, Chevron, meanwhile, opted, hold, capital, budget, steady, foreseeable, future, That, mean, continue, grow, production, chosen, conservative, course, Exxon, That, turn, could, lead, two, U, S, oil, giants, switch, places, production, growth, future, 
Chevron, looks, like, wins, front, today, past, investments, paying, right, Exxon, spending, could, turn, tables, future, Since, future, uncertain, Chevron, gets, nod, point, slim, margin, 
So, far, Exxon, seems, edge, Chevron, differences, two, companies, dramatic, You, could, pick, either, one, end, long, term, winner, And, brings, last, point, diversification, Both, Exxon, Chevron, integrated, oil, giants, investments, span, upstream, oil, gas, wells, downstream, refining, chemicals, And, public, prolific, distribution, notably, via, branded, gas, stations, 
However, first, nine, 2018, Exxon, downstream, operations, amounted, third, revenues, Chevron, downstream, business, made, 22, span, That, suggests, Chevron, little, exposed, ups, downs, oil, prices, Exxon, heavier, reliance, upstream, business, That, bad, thing, want, bias, toward, oil, prices, helps, explain, Chevron, chose, pause, dividend, oil, prices, falling, Exxon, bit, diversification, tad, less, leverage, able, weather, storm, stride, 
This, win, Exxon, investors, conservative, bent, However, believe, oil, prices, going, head, higher, Chevron, could, easily, called, winner, So, really, toss, 
When, look, points, one, thing, becomes, painfully, clear, Exxon, Chevron, pretty, similar, Neither, one, would, bad, energy, stock, invest, However, dividend, investors, particularly, conservative, Exxon, small, wins, four, six, points, give, edge, The, two, points, clear, enough, victories, either, company, push, Chevron, ahead, 
Commodities, base, products, pulled, Earth, beneath, us, allow, material, things, created, The, commodity, category, covers, broad, range, oil, iron, ore, gold, Without, products, cars, buildings, fancy, electronics, increasingly, dominating, world, If, looking, cash, fundamental, materials, three, top, commodity, stocks, look, 2019, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, BHP, Group, Limited, NYSE, BHP, Franco, Nevada, Corporation, TSX, FNV,

Exxon, business, spans, entire, value, chain, upstream, drilling, operations, downstream, refining, chemicals, businesses, create, products, gasoline, actually, get, used, day, day, life, This, diversification, helps, provide, balance, since, oil, price, swings, dramatic, swift, recent, oil, price, drop, clearly, demonstrates, Low, oil, prices, hurt, upstream, side, Exxon, business, oil, also, key, input, downstream, side, low, oil, prices, net, benefit, side, operation, 
In, addition, diversification, Exxon, also, highly, conservative, balance, sheet, Long, term, debt, makes, around, 10, capital, structure, placing, energy, giant, low, end, peer, group, leverage, front, It, essentially, designed, handle, ups, downs, energy, sector, Nothing, proves, incredible, 36, consecutive, annual, dividend, increases, company, amassed, And, stock, looks, relatively, cheap, today, trading, yield, around, 4, 1, higher, since, 1990s, price, tangible, book, value, lower, since, around, time,
