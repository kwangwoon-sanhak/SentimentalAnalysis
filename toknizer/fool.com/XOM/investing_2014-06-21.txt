Oil, gas, giant, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, aggressively, expanding, Russia, order, combat, sustained, production, declines, issue, past, half, decade, Since, 2009, ExxonMobil, production, measured, barrels, oil, equivalent, decreased, 7, 8, This, serious, problem, company, amount, products, producing, selling, decreasing, rather, increasing, By, expanding, Russia, ExxonMobil, hopes, undo, problem, 
Why, Russia, 
So, would, ExxonMobil, expand, Russia, country, Well, one, reason, Russia, incredibly, blessed, comes, oil, reserves, According, Energy, Information, Administration, Russia, total, proven, oil, reserves, 80, billion, barrels, beginning, 2013, largest, world, In, addition, Arctic, waters, coast, Siberia, believed, contain, 200, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, 
Russia, also, enormous, amounts, shale, oil, gas, completely, dwarf, anything, United, States, Some, estimates, put, total, amount, oil, contained, Russia, giant, Bazenhov, formation, nearly, two, trillion, barrels, This, four, ten, times, amount, highest, estimates, put, Bakken, shale, although, estimates, formations, vary, greatly, Regardless, Russia, far, nation, largest, oil, reserves, world, growth, plan, large, oil, producer, needs, include, giant, nation, 
Sakhalin, 1, Project, 
One, ExxonMobil, growth, projects, Russia, massive, Sakhalin, 1, project, located, Russian, Far, East, This, project, consists, development, three, oil, natural, gas, fields, Chayo, Odoptu, Arkutun, Dagi, located, northeastern, coast, Sakhalin, Island, 
Sakhalin, Island, large, island, located, north, Japan, east, coast, Russia, 
SOURCE, ARCTICECON, 
This, project, faces, challenges, local, climate, While, southern, part, Sakhalin, Island, cold, humid, northern, part, oil, gas, fields, located, sub, Arctic, climate, The, temperatures, vary, type, climate, means, ExxonMobil, needs, use, specially, built, equipment, rigs, owned, North, Atlantic, Drilling, NYSE, NADL, order, develop, fields, This, type, harsh, weather, equipment, tends, much, expensive, comparable, equipment, designed, operate, extremes, 
As, oil, gas, development, projects, Sakhalin, 1, project, carried, phases, meaning, resources, produced, grow, time, For, example, first, commercial, production, Odoptu, field, began, 2010, steadily, ramped, time, Production, Arktun, Dagi, field, scheduled, begin, As, new, production, begins, come, online, help, offset, company, declining, production, elsewhere, 
Laptev, Sea, 
ExxonMobil, also, teamed, Russia, oil, giant, Rosneft, explore, develop, two, oil, rich, reservoirs, Laptev, Sea, Anisinsk, Novosibirsk, Ust, Olenksk, These, two, reservoirs, located, Russian, Arctic, good, chance, yielding, large, amounts, resources, due, richness, area, If, two, companies, discover, rich, resources, area, likely, accretive, ExxonMobil, reserves, future, production, two, companies, begin, developing, producing, 
Foolish, takeaways, 
In, conclusion, ExxonMobil, business, activities, Russia, crucial, company, order, reverse, long, term, trend, declining, production, Through, strategic, partnership, Rosneft, company, access, country, enormous, Arctic, oil, reserves, Despite, current, sanctions, Russia, ExxonMobil, remains, committed, developing, resources, must, order, return, growth, trajectory,
