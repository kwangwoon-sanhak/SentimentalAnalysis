Oil, prices, gone, wild, ride, 2020, energy, companies, like, Exxon, Mobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, taking, massive, hits, top, bottom, lines, It, much, surprise, see, stocks, laid, low, well, Chevron, around, 28, far, Exxon, roughly, 38, If, looking, favor, energy, sector, investment, ideas, however, pair, might, worth, examining, But, one, better, pick, 
Although, oil, prices, literally, fell, zero, one, point, first, half, 2020, Chevron, Exxon, likely, survive, rough, patch, They, financially, strong, companies, second, diversified, operations, take, long, term, view, energy, market, That, means, examine, supply, demand, decades, Today, big, issue, supply, disruption, caused, global, economic, shutdowns, used, slow, spread, COVID, 19, That, big, problem, one, likely, linger, forever, noting, massive, efforts, around, world, develop, vaccine, 
Longer, term, Exxon, Chevron, recognize, clean, energy, headwinds, deal, However, changing, energy, sources, takes, time, likely, great, deal, leeway, today, carbon, heavy, energy, world, one, focused, carbon, light, power, options, So, reason, longer, term, optimism, well, Both, likely, get, current, energy, market, stride, regard, equal, footing, benefit, still, positive, long, term, trends, expect, unfold, 
That, said, Exxon, Chevron, strong, balance, sheets, relative, energy, major, peers, equal, footing, compared, At, start, 2020, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, around, 0, 25, times, fairly, modest, ratio, near, bottom, global, peer, group, However, Chevron, roughly, 0, 2, times, even, better, 
XOM, DEBT, TO, EQUITY, RATIO, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
At, risk, understatement, things, changed, little, since, start, Notably, Exxon, issued, material, amount, debt, continue, support, aggressive, capital, investment, plan, dividend, Its, debt, equity, ratio, currently, close, 0, 4, times, That, terrible, number, still, pretty, solid, compared, peers, But, Chevron, ratio, still, way, better, roughly, 0, 25, times, Chevron, issue, much, debt, support, operations, difficult, period, capital, investment, plans, sizable, Exxon, largely, currently, benefiting, previous, spending, When, looking, financial, strength, Chevron, clear, winner, even, though, solid, positions, relative, peers, 
That, brings, dividends, two, energy, giants, offer, Exxon, yield, huge, 8, dividend, increased, annually, 37, consecutive, Chevron, yield, modest, around, 5, 9, dividend, increased, 33, running, Both, companies, basically, stated, dividends, remain, important, avenues, returning, value, investors, 
That, said, Exxon, dividend, future, quite, certain, Chevron, That, two, percentage, point, difference, dividend, yields, two, stocks, offer, today, There, couple, reasons, starting, Exxon, higher, leverage, But, added, fact, Exxon, middle, spending, program, really, needs, finish, production, start, lag, behind, peers, Hitting, pause, really, good, long, term, option, If, push, came, shove, dividend, would, likely, sacrificed, noting, company, already, said, plan, add, debt, Chevron, production, spending, situations, nearly, dire, Put, simply, Chevron, dividend, looks, secure, Once, Chevron, comes, ahead, right, 
Ultimately, Exxon, Chevron, well, run, energy, companies, likely, muddle, downturn, Investors, looking, energy, play, would, probably, fine, either, one, However, conservative, investor, dividend, focus, Chevron, appears, better, shape, survive, continuing, reward, investors, via, dividends, right, If, owned, Exxon, many, may, make, sense, sell, looking, initiate, new, position, Chevron, probably, edge,
