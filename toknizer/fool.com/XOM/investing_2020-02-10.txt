When, asked, headline, grabbing, news, events, like, change, way, Chevron, looks, industry, Wirth, clear, They, reminder, risks, oil, companies, face, 
We, look, long, term, view, really, supply, demand, And, overlay, shorter, term, phenomena, thinking, price, 
He, alone, During, Exxon, NYSE, XOM, fourth, quarter, conference, call, CEO, Darren, Woods, discussed, choice, keep, investing, production, growth, despite, currently, low, oil, prices, explaining, investors, 
We, know, demand, continue, grow, driven, rising, population, economic, growth, higher, standards, living, We, know, excess, capacity, shrink, typically, faster, people, think, margins, rise, Then, new, capacity, needed, These, classic, price, cycles, capital, intensive, commodity, industries, 
Right, energy, markets, well, supplied, Chevron, Wirth, noted, In, fact, big, issue, really, much, supply, helping, keep, oil, natural, gas, prices, low, 
This, largely, rapid, growth, production, U, S, onshore, market, The, U, S, Energy, Information, Administration, EIA, estimates, U, S, crude, oil, production, reached, new, record, 2019, And, projects, production, increase, 2020, 2021, The, United, States, largest, oil, producer, world, according, EIA, 
That, bad, news, The, good, news, smaller, financially, weak, drillers, U, S, onshore, space, struggling, Many, going, bankrupt, As, Exxon, Woods, highlighted, normal, industry,

So, supply, basically, oil, industry, expects, demand, 
In, world, increasingly, focused, ESG, investing, halting, global, warming, could, big, problem, This, true, long, term, carbon, fuels, today, integral, part, global, energy, pie, easily, quickly, displaced, Oil, example, took, roughly, 100, replace, coal, dominant, global, energy, source, Oil, eventually, replaced, world, still, needs, oil, gas, 
The, International, Energy, Agency, IEA, recently, provided, world, energy, outlook, 2020, Based, currently, stated, global, warming, goals, countries, around, world, expects, oil, demand, grow, 2025, pretty, much, plateau, 2040, Demand, natural, gas, meanwhile, continues, grow, fairly, strongly, way, 2040, 
Simply, put, oil, natural, gas, going, away, A, growing, global, population, notably, developing, markets, increasing, global, prosperity, key, drivers, Sure, world, could, get, serious, global, warming, would, reduce, demand, far, countries, actually, managed, live, stated, goals, If, trend, continues, IEA, projections, might, even, prove, negative, 
There, another, factor, consider, well, Oil, natural, gas, depleting, assets, So, barrel, pulled, ground, gone, good, And, oil, wells, produce, forever, production, wells, notably, U, S, shale, starting, slow, within, couple,
