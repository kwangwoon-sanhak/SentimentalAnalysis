In, early, 2018, ExxonMobil, launched, long, term, strategy, boost, production, profitability, cash, flow, At, time, company, believed, output, would, rise, slightly, less, 4, million, barrels, oil, equivalent, per, day, BOE, D, 5, million, BOE, D, 2025, Fueling, growth, plan, invest, high, return, projects, places, like, Permian, Basin, offshore, Guyana, Because, focus, returns, Exxon, believed, earnings, cash, flow, would, double, 2017, level, improvement, oil, prices, 
Exxon, updated, outlook, earlier, It, sees, Permian, position, alone, pumping, 1, million, BOE, D, 2024, 80, increase, prior, forecast, Driving, optimistic, view, better, expected, drilling, results, land, acquired, 2017, Because, company, outperformance, elsewhere, Exxon, sees, earnings, growing, 140, 2025, 2017, baseline,

ExxonMobil, plan, makes, lot, sense, paper, However, several, issues, could, potentially, derail, strategy, including, underwhelming, well, results, oil, prices, 
So, far, Exxon, well, results, Permian, Basin, offshore, Guyana, outpaced, expectations, In, Permian, Basin, example, production, surged, 20, sequentially, second, quarter, 90, past, However, Concho, Resources, NYSE, CXO, one, region, largest, drillers, reported, second, quarter, well, spacing, test, underperformed, expectations, 
Concho, noted, spaced, wells, close, caused, reserves, deplete, faster, anticipated, That, suggests, drillers, might, running, top, tier, drilling, inventory, If, Exxon, runs, similar, problems, acreage, could, negatively, impact, company, ability, achieve, bold, growth, plan, 
Meanwhile, company, still, early, stages, development, offshore, Guyana, first, phase, expected, come, online, early, next, Exxon, partners, expected, develop, five, production, platforms, 2025, would, enable, pump, 750, 000, barrels, per, day, However, given, early, company, development, lot, could, go, wrong, Delays, getting, equipment, approvals, well, poor, well, results, could, impact, Guyana, ability, deliver, growth, returns, Exxon, expects, 
The, potential, issue, could, derail, Exxon, strategy, oil, prices, Oil, quite, volatile, since, Exxon, launched, plan, likely, continue, fluctuate, coming, However, even, greater, concern, oil, market, continued, disruption, alternative, energy, sources, 
While, electric, vehicles, example, currently, represent, small, percentage, new, car, sales, adoption, accelerating, If, trend, continues, could, dent, oil, demand, growth, would, likely, weigh, oil, prices, If, crude, drifts, 2017, level, coming, due, oversupply, Exxon, growth, waste, 
Exxon, growing, increasingly, confident, long, term, growth, strategy, The, oil, giant, success, Permian, offshore, Guyana, track, double, earnings, 2025, improvement, oil, prices, 
While, several, risks, could, derail, strategy, Exxon, remains, track, create, significant, value, investors, coming, That, makes, one, compelling, oil, stocks, consider, buying, long, haul,
