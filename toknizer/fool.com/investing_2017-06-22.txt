Eni, S, p, A, NYSE, E, huge, 8, 5, dividend, yield, Royal, Dutch, Shell, plc, NYSE, RDS, B, yield, 6, 5, BP, plc, NYSE, BP, 6, 8, Total, SA, NYSE, TOT, sports, 6, 6, Chevron, Corporation, NYSE, CVX, meanwhile, yield, slightly, 4, leaving, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, lowest, yielding, oil, major, around, 3, 7, If, care, yield, go, international, oil, major, Eni, But, want, Exxon, proved, reward, investors, thick, thin, 
You, could, spend, lot, time, comparing, oil, giants, operations, And, important, nuances, name, For, example, Eni, huge, opportunities, expand, production, within, portfolio, Total, fairly, aggressively, growing, electricity, business, diversify, portfolio, Royal, Dutch, Shell, made, opportunistic, debt, fueled, acquisition, expand, business, oil, downturn, integrating, BP, finally, looks, might, putting, massive, Gulf, Mexico, oil, disaster, rearview, mirror, And, ExxonMobil, historically, near, top, peer, group, return, capital, employed, 
Meanwhile, oil, majors, roughly, similar, things, deal, drop, oil, prices, started, mid, 2014, That, included, trimming, capital, budgets, streamlining, operations, selling, non, core, assets, protect, top, bottom, lines, For, example, Chevron, reduced, exploration, spending, roughly, 50, since, 2014, lowered, operating, sales, general, administrative, costs, around, 25, 
These, important, facts, need, know, But, dividend, investor, something, else, keep, eye, dividend, growth, 
If, like, prize, dividend, consistency, That, means, focusing, companies, long, impressive, records, supporting, dividends, thick, thin, Better, yet, companies, regularly, increase, dividends, If, use, dividend, growth, part, screening, filter, find, one, oil, major, stands, test, 
BP, example, forced, restructure, business, cut, dividend, Deepwater, Horizon, oil, spill, And, dividend, growing, lately, steady, climb, Mix, two, together, I, happy, elsewhere, 
Eni, despite, massive, yield, fails, dividend, test, That, trimmed, distribution, nearly, 30, 2015, almost, soon, oil, price, decline, started, hit, home, That, inspire, confidence, dividend, sustainable, even, cut, No, thanks, 
Shell, increased, dividend, since, 2014, focused, paying, debt, related, big, BG, Group, acquisition, It, also, using, scrip, dividend, help, preserve, cash, I, like, Shell, opportunistic, move, using, downturn, expand, business, I, believe, dividend, danger, cut, But, stagnant, dividend, makes, pause, even, I, like, broader, story, 
Total, dividend, stayed, grown, 30, Not, surprisingly, 2014, 2015, two, period, dividend, grow, It, nice, Total, cut, dividend, Eni, dividend, started, grow, albeit, single, euro, 2016, So, I, dismiss, Total, option, But, better, choices, prefer, get, annual, pay, raises, 
CHEVRON, HAS, SUCCESSFULLY, TRIMMED, COSTS, BUT, DON, T, FORGET, THE, DIVIDEND, IMAGE, SOURCE, CHEVRON, CORPORATION, 
Chevron, increased, dividend, annually, 29, That, record, I, like, clean, fact, It, byproduct, company, increasing, dividend, middle, calendar, For, example, held, dividend, steady, 10, quarters, 2014, 2016, That, two, half, increase, even, though, annual, streak, remained, alive, Not, exactly, I, looking, 
And, ExxonMobil, Exxon, 35, history, increasing, dividend, That, includes, actual, dividend, increase, every, deep, oil, downturn, Although, Exxon, lowest, yield, oil, majors, also, impressive, dividend, history, It, best, dividend, option, book, 
I, suggesting, annual, dividend, growth, factor, look, As, I, mentioned, subtle, large, differences, oil, majors, But, dividend, consistency, important, need, keep, fact, high, checklist, Basically, oil, majors, Exxon, alone, proved, returns, value, investors, dividend, increases, Sure, yield, relatively, low, trade, might, willing, accept, ensure, dividend, checks, keep, coming, growing, 
On, one, hand, oil, gas, producer, Apache, NASDAQ, APA, decent, dividend, stock, At, current, market, price, payout, rate, company, sports, 2, 05, dividend, yield, While, eye, catching, average, since, edges, 1, 89, yield, S, P, 500, 
That, said, company, yield, likely, high, enough, entice, income, investors, especially, considering, higher, risks, associated, oil, gas, industry, That, dividend, investors, forget, Apache, focus, better, options, Three, stand, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, Occidental, Petroleum, NYSE, OXY, 
ExxonMobil, Dividend, Aristocrat, makes, royalty, among, income, stocks, Overall, oil, behemoth, increased, payout, 35, straight, whereas, Apache, dividend, risen, since, 2013, likely, go, either, Furthermore, ExxonMobil, currently, yields, enticing, 3, 7, almost, twice, market, average, well, Apache, More, importantly, company, fully, support, payout, despite, lower, oil, prices, Last, quarter, example, ExxonMobil, generated, 8, 2, billion, cash, flow, operations, covered, 3, 1, billion, dividends, shareholders, 4, 2, billion, capital, expenditures, room, spare, 
While, company, struggle, cover, capex, dividend, 2016, due, crashing, oil, prices, still, generated, 22, 1, billion, cash, flow, satisfied, 12, 5, billion, dividend, outlay, 19, 3, billion, capital, expenditures, One, drivers, Exxon, ability, generate, much, cash, flow, integrated, business, model, includes, refineries, chemical, plants, assets, Apache, operate, Those, operations, generated, 8, 8, billion, earnings, last, company, helping, offset, cash, flow, lost, lower, oil, prices, ExxonMobil, also, one, highest, credit, ratings, world, backed, low, debt, capital, 18, much, stronger, Apache, 47, level, Because, factors, ExxonMobil, flexibility, continue, financing, growth, shareholder, returns, periods, market, weakness, making, great, dividend, stock, long, term, 
Chevron, also, oil, behemoth, though, 200, billion, market, cap, quite, bit, smaller, 350, billion, gorilla, ExxonMobil, In, addition, Chevron, also, qualifies, Dividend, Aristocrat, payout, growth, streak, slightly, less, 29, That, said, currently, boast, higher, yield, 4, almost, double, Apache, pays, 
While, company, fall, short, covering, payout, cash, flow, operations, last, trend, reversed, 2017, due, cost, reductions, higher, oil, prices, Last, outspend, would, also, worse, Chevron, downstream, refining, chemicals, business, Those, assets, generated, 3, 4, billion, earnings, last, helped, offset, 2, 5, billion, loss, company, recorded, upstream, segment, That, diversification, combined, strong, balance, sheet, evidenced, 20, debt, capital, ratio, key, factor, Chevron, ability, pay, growing, dividend, nearly, three, decades, 
Occidental, Petroleum, 5, currently, boasts, highest, yield, group, While, quite, storied, dividend, past, Exxon, Chevron, still, dividend, champion, energy, sector, since, increased, payout, 14, consecutive, These, increases, robust, well, company, delivered, 500, increase, payout, since, 2002, 
Aside, growing, oil, output, another, reason, Occidental, Petroleum, able, boost, payout, owns, several, countercyclical, assets, generate, cash, flow, oil, gas, prices, decline, While, company, refining, assets, several, chemical, plants, including, recently, completed, Ingleside, Ethane, plant, jointly, owns, Mexichem, Add, fact, Occidental, Petroleum, cash, rich, balance, sheet, low, leverage, 27, debt, capital, capacity, maintain, dividend, long, term, even, crude, oil, averages, 40, per, barrel, 
While, Apache, pays, better, average, dividend, increased, Furthermore, lack, owning, countercyclical, chemical, refining, assets, along, higher, leverage, keeps, payout, level, well, rivals, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Occidental, Petroleum, That, income, investors, cross, Apache, list, potentials, focus, three, oil, stocks, instead, better, income, options, long, term, 
International, oil, major, Eni, SpA, NYSE, E, huge, 8, 4, dividend, yield, double, ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, 3, 7, yield, But, fat, yield, make, Eni, better, dividend, stock, To, fair, reasons, like, Eni, beyond, dividend, yield, including, huge, opportunities, presented, Zohr, project, Egypt, Mozambique, natural, gas, fields, But, despite, positives, three, reasons, ExxonMobil, better, choice, dividend, investors, higher, yielding, Eni, 
At, end, first, quarter, long, term, debt, made, 28, Eni, capital, structure, That, unreasonable, level, debt, means, However, Eni, core, business, selling, commodity, subject, often, large, sudden, price, swings, Which, exactly, happened, mid, 2014, oil, fell, 100, barrel, 30, barrel, area, worst, decline, Oil, prices, moved, higher, since, point, hovering, 40, 50, per, barrel, range, lately, still, well, highs, 
Exxon, long, term, debt, makes, 12, capital, structure, That, gives, oil, giant, material, amount, flexibility, Eni, In, fact, Exxon, made, extensive, use, balance, sheet, strength, downturn, support, business, dividend, At, start, 2014, long, term, debt, roughly, 5, capital, structure, Eni, long, term, debt, comparison, around, 26, capital, structure, start, 2014, 
Clearly, Eni, capacity, support, business, debt, still, Which, helps, explain, Eni, sold, stake, Mozambique, gas, field, Exxon, And, partnered, BP, Zohr, project, Basically, get, piece, Eni, high, profile, projects, without, buying, Eni, heavy, debt, load, In, opinion, Exxon, solid, balance, sheet, better, option, 
The, next, reason, prefer, Exxon, Eni, basic, business, company, Exxon, truly, integrated, oil, major, oil, natural, gas, drilling, balanced, chemicals, refining, assets, To, highlight, benefit, Exxon, earnings, income, taxes, fell, roughly, 50, 2015, really, bad, oil, companies, But, earnings, chemicals, business, slightly, downstream, earnings, doubled, refining, benefited, falling, oil, prices, That, helped, offset, massive, 75, drop, earnings, upstream, oil, gas, drilling, business, In, fact, downstream, business, earned, almost, much, absolute, basis, upstream, business, This, balanced, approach, allowed, Exxon, report, profit, full, 
Now, compare, Eni, diversified, business, heavily, weighted, toward, exploration, production, Adjusted, net, profit, 2015, fell, massive, 90, asset, write, downs, pushing, company, earnings, deep, red, It, simply, balance, offset, decline, oil, natural, gas, side, business, To, give, idea, scale, problem, 2015, adjusted, earnings, downstream, business, totaled, 387, million, euro, compared, 4, 1, billion, euro, provided, upstream, segment, In, words, Eni, needed, diversification, downstream, business, little, rounding, error, I, take, Exxon, truly, diversified, business, thanks, 
If, Eni, big, yield, attracted, name, step, back, take, look, company, dividend, history, Between, 2014, 2015, cut, dividend, roughly, 30, Essentially, first, sign, trouble, shareholders, took, dividend, haircut, When, look, Eni, leverage, relative, Exxon, relative, lack, diversification, business, see, decision, made, And, probably, right, move, company, However, relying, dividend, checks, cut, would, hurt, At, point, look, Eni, dividend, secure, environment, Note, currency, fluctuations, recently, pushed, Eni, dividend, even, lower, dollar, terms, euros, remained, level, since, cut, 
E, DIVIDEND, PER, SHARE, ANNUAL, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
ExxonMobil, hand, used, balance, sheet, strength, truly, diversified, business, model, keep, rewarding, investors, annual, dividend, increases, downturn, The, company, annual, streak, 35, consecutive, making, Exxon, dividend, aristocrat, Recent, hikes, modest, historical, increases, expected, difficult, industry, environment, The, real, point, Exxon, wins, hands, compared, Eni, comes, returning, value, shareholders, via, consistently, growing, dividend, 
Eni, offers, investors, massive, yield, right, But, look, past, positives, oil, giant, offset, negatives, Eni, less, financial, flexibility, Exxon, less, inspiring, dividend, track, record, absolute, relative, basis, lacks, diversification, Exxon, business, offers, difference, showed, notably, 2015, Eni, chose, trim, dividend, Exxon, proven, dividend, commitment, 35, consecutive, despite, relatively, low, yield, I, rather, Exxon, Eni, day,
