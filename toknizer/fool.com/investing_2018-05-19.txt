To, end, Exxon, looking, projects, invest, start, growing, production, It, successfully, lined, host, big, oil, natural, gas, deals, provide, material, growth, opportunities, including, plans, invest, onshore, U, S, oil, gas, deepwater, oil, Guyana, Brazil, gas, production, Mozambique, And, plans, expand, downstream, operations, refining, chemicals, top, 
All, cost, money, In, 2018, Exxon, capital, spending, plan, require, 24, billion, roughly, 1, billion, 2017, Spending, 2019, jumps, 28, billion, three, much, 30, billion, That, lot, money, door, especially, company, paid, roughly, 13, billion, investors, 2017, form, dividends, Can, Exxon, afford, support, dividend, capital, spending, plans, 
In, 2017, oil, giant, dividends, growth, spending, covered, cash, flow, required, little, help, asset, sales, With, higher, prices, however, 2018, gotten, stronger, start, Capital, spending, dividends, cost, roughly, 8, 2, billion, first, quarter, cash, flow, 10, billion, That, 10, billion, includes, 1, 4, billion, asset, sales, counted, every, quarter, remain, key, part, Exxon, plan, prunes, assets, better, focus, business, raise, much, needed, cash,

Oil, prices, continued, rise, clearly, making, easier, Exxon, cover, spending, plans, So, long, oil, prices, remain, steady, move, higher, Exxon, cushion, Higher, oil, prices, also, make, easier, company, get, top, dollar, divestments, makes, 
That, said, another, place, Exxon, find, cash, balance, sheet, The, company, long, term, debt, rose, dramatically, oil, downturn, started, mid, 2014, going, 6, 5, billion, end, 2013, peak, 27, 7, billion, end, 2016, It, dropped, roughly, 23, 2017, company, used, improved, oil, prices, pare, debt, load, 
However, even, peak, 2016, long, term, debt, accounted, around, 15, company, capital, structure, That, relatively, high, Exxon, high, relative, broader, integrated, oil, peer, group, Take, look, graph, Exxon, debt, equity, ratio, way, bottom, wide, margin, compared, European, peers, In, words, Exxon, always, rely, balance, sheet, carry, spending, front,

However, forget, impact, company, spending, Although, actually, predict, oil, project, going, play, real, world, drawing, board, plans, look, promising, For, example, Exxon, reserves, increased, 6, 2017, based, exploration, efforts, Assuming, turn, additional, oil, production, higher, sales, volumes, also, part, mix, And, provide, even, cushion, dividend, 
Clearly, Exxon, spending, plans, going, cost, lot, money, However, oil, prices, remain, strong, looks, like, Exxon, cover, dividend, capital, spending, needs, That, may, require, additional, asset, sales, along, way, pruning, portfolio, bad, thing, unusual, And, shortfall, given, integrated, oil, giant, still, strong, balance, sheet, fall, back, 
Meanwhile, assume, successful, drilling, efforts, rising, production, also, help, It, might, pretty, every, quarter, Exxon, appears, financially, capable, maintaining, dividend, despite, ambitious, growth, plans, Concerned, investors, pushing, Exxon, stock, lower, yield, 4, This, looks, like, buying, opportunity, patient, long, term, investors,
