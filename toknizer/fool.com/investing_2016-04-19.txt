OIL, PRICES, COULD, REMAIN, DEPRESSED, AFTER, PRODUCERS, FAILED, TO, AGREE, ON, A, PRODUCTION, FREEZE, IMAGE, SOURCE, THE, MOTLEY, FOOL, 
This, suggests, oil, investors, fully, appreciate, risks, following, failure, Doha, talks, In, worst, case, scenario, oil, market, might, rebalance, late, 2017, even, 2018, leading, lot, pain, oil, companies, ranging, industry, titan, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, shale, pioneer, Continental, Resources, NYSE, CLR, 
The, oil, market, rebalancing, 
After, oil, prices, plummeted, late, 2014, oil, industry, pundits, expected, relatively, quick, rebound, low, prices, forcing, relatively, high, cost, U, S, shale, production, market, Nevertheless, U, S, output, remained, stubbornly, high, throughout, 2015, 
However, U, S, production, finally, started, decline, steadily, As, early, April, U, S, crude, oil, production, 400, 000, barrels, per, day, compared, earlier, according, Energy, Information, Administration, 
Based, decline, supply, U, S, producers, outside, OPEC, along, projected, 1, 2, million, barrel, per, day, rise, demand, International, Energy, Agency, forecast, supply, demand, move, back, balance, second, half, 2016, 
However, forecast, assumes, OPEC, production, holds, roughly, steady, Yet, Iran, hopes, boost, production, least, 4, million, barrels, per, day, early, 2017, 3, 2, million, barrels, per, day, February, Meanwhile, Iran, refused, join, major, oil, producers, freezing, production, Saudi, Arabia, threatened, raise, production, another, 1, million, barrels, per, day, 
Of, course, possible, Iran, production, ramp, take, longer, planned, There, also, decent, chance, Saudi, Arabia, threats, boost, output, bluff, And, supply, disruptions, constant, risk, But, Iran, Saudi, Arabia, increase, production, without, corresponding, declines, elsewhere, OPEC, oil, market, remain, flooded, least, one, 
Oil, bulls, ignore, risks,

Yet, oil, billionaires, like, Hamm, consistently, underestimated, threat, OPEC, lately, Indeed, Hamm, called, OPEC, toothless, tiger, late, 2014, cashed, Continental, Resources, oil, hedges, back, oil, still, traded, 80, per, barrel, anticipating, quick, recovery, This, foolish, decision, cost, Continental, Resources, roughly, 1, billion, last, 
If, oil, bulls, like, Hamm, cavalier, money, line, Hamm, owns, two, thirds, Continental, Resources, empty, prognostications, deserve, even, skepticism, 
Oil, investors, need, watch,

ExxonMobil, fared, little, better, last, net, income, 50, However, ExxonMobil, helped, multibillion, dollar, increase, downstream, profits, refining, margins, surged, 
Like, oil, producers, ExxonMobil, face, earnings, pressure, oil, price, declines, But, also, contend, shrinking, downstream, profits, refining, margins, significantly, around, globe, As, result, analysts, currently, expect, earnings, per, share, sink, another, 39, 2016, 
Investors, clearly, betting, quick, bounce, back, oil, companies, including, ExxonMobil, Continental, Resources, beginning, later, 2017, If, market, share, war, Iran, Saudi, Arabia, prevents, oil, market, rebalancing, late, 2017, 2018, companies, lot, pain, Investors, underestimate, risk,
