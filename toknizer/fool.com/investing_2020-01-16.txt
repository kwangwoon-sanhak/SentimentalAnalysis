ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, get, lot, respect, today, market, heavy, spending, boost, production, yet, generate, notable, improvements, That, could, change, Here, couple, reasons, dividend, investors, might, still, find, Exxon, interest, despite, ugly, image, 
Despite, dirty, image, ESG, investors, rooting, demise, oil, natural, gas, Exxon, peers, clear, believe, market, commodities, remain, vital, one, many, Simply, put, people, around, world, still, demanding, easily, portable, well, supported, fuels, That, however, change, fact, oil, natural, gas, selling, relatively, low, prices, today, putting, pressure, profits, throughout, energy, sector, And, glamorous, fact, Exxon, production, declining, 
To, put, numbers, last, point, Exxon, oil, equivalent, output, dropped, 1, 2016, It, fell, another, 1, 7, 2017, Then, declined, 2018, time, 2, 6, And, 2019, final, results, yet, unlikely, robust, growth, But, important, inflection, point, made, growth, resuming, quarterly, basis, progressed, 
Despite, important, shift, Exxon, stock, remains, laggard, relative, broader, market, many, peers, absolute, basis, For, example, past, five, Exxon, stock, around, 23, lags, well, behind, closest, peers, The, underperformance, noteworthy, since, next, worst, performer, Royal, Dutch, Shell, 7, span, The, S, P, 500, Index, reference, 60, period, 
Weak, production, one, piece, puzzle, another, The, money, company, spending, boost, production, 35, billion, materially, improved, Exxon, return, capital, employed, numbers, ROCE, That, basically, measure, well, company, using, shareholders, capital, Where, Exxon, industry, leader, sits, many, peers, 
But, problems, actually, set, potential, opportunity, value, conscious, investors, particularly, flair, dividend, stocks, For, example, Exxon, 5, yield, near, 30, high, The, company, price, tangible, book, value, near, 40, low, though, roughly, middle, pack, relative, peers, In, words, historically, speaking, Exxon, looks, cheap, 
To, extent, Exxon, relatively, weak, stock, performance, understandable, The, often, volatile, prices, oil, natural, gas, key, drivers, financial, performance, prices, commodities, low, volatile, lately, Production, declines, weak, ROCE, numbers, also, something, energy, investors, like, see, A, lack, enthusiasm, makes, complete, sense, 
However, number, reasons, positive, investors, may, paying, enough, attention, For, starters, Exxon, continues, one, strongest, balance, sheets, oil, major, peers, despite, middle, material, investment, program, In, words, financial, strength, weather, weak, market, continue, invest, future, 
That, said, investments, Exxon, making, starting, show, results, As, noted, production, appears, turning, corner, That, however, come, strength, one, big, projects, onshore, U, S, oil, drilling, To, put, number, production, business, increased, massive, 73, third, quarter, 2019, And, start, management, still, expects, double, production, current, levels, 2025, So, still, lot, growth, come,

Then, fact, one, oil, giant, big, offshore, projects, located, Guyana, came, online, late, 2019, This, happened, late, 2019, material, effect, production, numbers, provide, notable, boost, 2020, results, In, near, term, output, region, expected, around, 120, 000, barrels, per, day, However, number, projected, increase, six, fold, 2025, additional, wells, Guyana, get, drilled, In, words, like, company, onshore, U, S, production, looks, like, multi, period, growth, starting, take, hold, 
Behind, two, projects, new, upstream, opportunities, Brazil, Mozambique, others, So, weak, production, numbers, Exxon, appears, verge, upturn, That, may, may, show, 2019, production, results, change, direction, likely, become, increasingly, apparent, near, future, And, trend, probably, continue, several, And, exploration, read, spending, phase, projects, gives, way, production, phase, reasonable, expect, Exxon, ROCE, improve, well, Oil, gas, prices, continue, driving, force, Exxon, investors, still, likely, take, different, view, stock, production, gets, back, growth, track, 
While, true, Exxon, probably, see, big, stock, gain, without, oil, rally, clearly, making, progress, turning, production, around, That, progress, begin, show, notably, 2020, second, big, project, comes, online, Investors, likely, rethink, dour, view, energy, giant, happens, especially, upturn, ROCE, follows, There, still, sorts, reasons, dislike, Exxon, environmental, impact, using, carbon, fuels, ESG, investors, remains, attractive, like, buy, stocks, sale, That, augmented, fact, positive, catalyst, horizon, help, earn, love, investors, If, wait, long, though, might, miss, Wall, Street, catches, good, news, developing, Exxon,
