Today, go, history, The, price, barrel, West, Texas, Intermediate, WTI, oil, plunged, negative, territory, One, contract, sold, jaw, dropping, negative, 37, 36, barrel, That, 50, WTI, contracts, traded, last, Friday, 
Usually, price, action, like, would, put, enormous, pressure, oil, stocks, However, barely, budged, things, considered, Shares, oil, giants, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, example, 5, mid, afternoon, Meanwhile, even, financially, troubled, oil, companies, Helix, Energy, Solutions, NYSE, HLX, Matador, Resources, NYSE, MTDR, Northern, Oil, Gas, NYSEMKT, NOG, SM, Energy, NYSE, SM, sold, 10, 
The, May, WTI, contract, expires, futures, market, closes, Tuesday, cratered, today, oil, traders, scrambled, get, position, That, must, take, physical, delivery, oil, problem, given, country, running, storage, space, That, leaving, choice, pay, unload, contracts, since, would, cost, money, store, anyway, 
However, May, WTI, contract, plummeted, today, expire, next, declined, 4, barrel, around, 20, Meanwhile, contracts, global, oil, benchmark, Brent, also, expires, June, fell, roughly, 8, today, approximately, 25, 75, barrel, Going, decline, contract, price, oil, even, moderate, December, WTI, contracts, lost, 1, still, trade, 30, barrel, 
Because, market, tends, forward, looking, starting, discount, near, term, storage, issues, It, sees, oil, producers, U, S, shutting, wells, OPEC, non, members, agreed, reduce, supplies, Those, issues, eventually, enable, economy, burn, excess, oil, sitting, storage, That, large, oil, companies, Exxon, Chevron, barely, declined, today, 
Still, hope, oil, back, 30, barrel, December, ideal, oil, companies, especially, smaller, producers, Matador, Resources, Northern, Oil, Gas, SM, Energy, well, services, providers, Helix, Energy, Solutions, There, growing, concerns, companies, might, survive, oil, market, downturn, 
Matador, Resources, example, dangerously, close, running, liquidity, crunch, according, analysts, Wells, Fargo, Meanwhile, SM, Energy, already, slashed, dividend, preserve, financial, flexibility, If, industry, conditions, improve, companies, might, end, bankruptcy, 
WTI, went, negative, today, traders, abandoned, positions, nearest, term, contract, expires, tomorrow, While, sales, put, pressure, oil, stocks, cause, implosion, since, representative, overall, pricing, market, oil, Still, persistent, weakness, oil, prices, undoubtedly, affect, financially, weaker, producers, several, likely, go, coming, 
Oil, prices, dumps, thanks, ugly, mix, world, events, situation, likely, take, long, time, resolve, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, earnings, already, pressure, oil, downturn, deepened, numbers, going, look, much, worse, 
That, investors, long, term, view, focus, things, Exxon, control, And, front, quite, well, 
If, listen, energy, industry, CEO, talk, likely, discuss, long, term, supply, demand, fundamentals, Yes, current, energy, prices, important, heads, companies, know, operate, highly, cyclical, industry, prices, move, rapidly, often, dramatically, In, fact, heads, Exxon, Chevron, Royal, Dutch, Shell, highlighted, growing, population, lead, increasing, long, term, demand, energy, sources, Thus, oil, increasingly, natural, gas, vital, That, near, term, ups, downs, industry, less, important, long, term, fundamentals, underpin, demand, 
IMAGE, SOURCE, GETTY, IMAGES, 
Still, investor, hard, ignore, negatives, today, For, one, thing, increasing, production, United, States, upended, long, term, industry, dynamics, pushed, prices, OPEC, attempting, manage, industry, shifts, cutting, production, U, S, filled, whatever, void, left, Eventually, OPEC, Russia, got, tiff, additional, cuts, sent, oil, prices, tumbling, anew, fears, oil, price, war, Then, countries, around, world, essentially, shut, attempt, contain, spread, COVID, 19, drastically, reducing, demand, oil, time, supply, high, expected, go, even, higher, 
Although, OPEC, Russia, United, States, appear, brokered, truce, feared, oil, price, battle, likely, little, late, Demand, reduction, related, coronavirus, led, buildup, oil, sitting, storage, That, oil, worked, prices, start, sustained, rise, The, extra, oil, however, worked, material, way, global, economic, activity, allowed, start, following, COVID, 19, shut, So, earnings, bad, oil, companies, like, Exxon, likely, stay, bad, In, fact, companies, throughout, industry, pulling, back, capital, spending, plans, save, money, reduce, supply, Exxon, pledged, trim, spending, roughly, 33, billion, 2020, 23, billion, 30, drop, It, also, looking, cut, expenses, around, 15, 
Long, term, investors, however, despair, It, may, take, bit, industry, supply, demand, dynamics, get, back, line, industry, cutbacks, likely, lead, situation, oil, prices, recover, That, goes, cyclical, industry, like, energy, Exxon, prepared, making, necessary, changes, muddle, example, issuing, debt, ample, cash, fund, business, revenue, cyclically, weak, 
So, Exxon, order, deal, difficult, market, environment, Sure, 2019, great, top, bottom, line, remove, asset, sales, 2020, likely, worse, But, Exxon, rolling, punches, many, times, Note, company, increased, dividend, 37, consecutive, impressive, track, record, cyclical, industry, You, achieve, kind, dividend, history, without, lot, things, right, along, way, 
That, something, investors, focus, Exxon, Instead, worrying, something, management, control, oil, prices, look, control, And, front, lot, going, well, today, 
For, example, Exxon, expanding, production, onshore, U, S, space, using, scale, technological, expertise, rapidly, cost, effectively, increase, output, Production, region, massive, 79, 2019, living, guidance, company, providing, Admittedly, kind, growth, rate, continue, long, simply, law, large, numbers, low, price, oil, today, Exxon, actually, looking, pull, back, region, This, makes, sense, given, U, S, unconventional, oil, wells, relatively, easy, develop, compared, offshore, oil, wells, example, Thus, production, ramped, fairly, quickly, making, prime, candidate, moderating, production, 
But, success, Exxon, region, testament, company, ability, execute, big, projects, When, oil, prices, rise, highly, likely, time, expect, ramp, onshore, U, S, production, 
XOM, EPS, DILUTED, QUARTERLY, DATA, BY, YCHARTS, 
Getting, big, projects, done, core, competence, Exxon, That, really, starts, become, apparent, look, efforts, waters, Guyana, It, first, found, oil, area, 2015, since, time, identified, 16, potential, drill, sites, The, amount, oil, believes, found, gone, around, two, billion, barrels, 2015, eight, billion, And, getting, started, production, front, Liza, project, starting, ahead, schedule, It, produce, around, 120, 000, barrels, oil, day, 2020, Over, time, Guyana, region, could, produce, much, 800, 000, barrels, oil, day, new, drill, sites, exploited, 
Exxon, business, spans, upstream, drilling, downstream, chemicals, refining, working, upgrade, business, across, entire, spectrum, The, goal, downstream, side, move, value, chain, produce, premium, products, These, projects, generally, smaller, building, offshore, oil, rigs, often, along, lines, upgrades, existing, assets, 
However, Exxon, fourth, quarter, 2019, earnings, conference, call, CEO, Darren, Woods, pleased, note, Exxon, completed, three, downstream, projects, eight, chemicals, business, Although, margins, chemicals, refining, space, low, today, hampering, earnings, company, successfully, repositioning, better, days, 
When, Exxon, reports, first, quarter, 2020, earnings, numbers, going, dismal, But, get, caught, earnings, going, terrible, throughout, energy, sector, Focus, instead, Exxon, ability, things, said, would, For, last, couple, executed, well, front, And, pullback, spending, driven, low, oil, prices, slow, company, progress, degree, Exxon, releases, quarterly, earnings, 2020, pay, attention, things, control, successful, exploration, project, execution, things, oil, prices, Do, likely, come, away, far, positive, view, situation,
