ExxonMobil, Corporation, NYSE, XOM, one, world, largest, integrated, energy, companies, If, thinking, investing, oil, natural, gas, industry, put, diversified, global, player, short, list, Here, seven, reasons, could, good, time, buy, stock, plan, hold, forever, 
One, biggest, knocks, oil, world, moving, away, dirty, carbon, based, fuels, That, may, true, long, term, going, transition, instant, cut, For, example, OPEC, world, oil, outlook, influential, oil, organization, highlights, continued, population, growth, key, driver, slowly, expanding, energy, demand, 
OPEC, expects, renewable, energy, demand, grow, faster, energy, option, 2040, 6, 6, annual, growth, rate, Note, relatively, small, base, Oil, demand, meanwhile, still, expected, grow, 0, 6, annually, That, may, sound, like, much, enough, increase, total, demand, 17, 2014, 2040, Yes, renewables, making, headlines, oil, going, away, anytime, soon, And, enough, room, oil, demand, grow, even, slice, total, pie, declines, 
This, big, picture, first, reason, look, ExxonMobil, hype, oil, going, away, overblown, 
The, second, reason, like, Exxon, global, reach, product, breadth, This, goes, beyond, concept, Exxon, operations, around, world, thus, reliant, one, region, support, business, After, oil, globally, traded, commodity, easy, transport, one, reasons, fuel, popular, Being, right, places, world, good, enough,

The, real, benefit, diversification, Exxon, goes, little, deeper, For, example, operations, offshore, drilling, onshore, drilling, Canadian, oil, sands, drills, oil, gas, uses, oil, gas, make, chemicals, refined, products, like, gasoline, Drilling, oil, huge, part, business, part, And, even, comes, drilling, Exxon, one, thing, 
Take, look, 2015, quick, example, benefits, diversification, It, horrible, company, drilling, operations, saw, earnings, fall, roughly, 75, oil, prices, fell, The, company, downstream, operations, though, saw, earnings, double, benefiting, lower, oil, prices, improving, company, refining, margins, That, enough, make, declines, upstream, business, certainly, helped, soften, blow, deep, oil, downturn, Exxon, broad, diversification, help, stick, around, even, worst, times, 
Points, one, two, available, oil, majors, including, Chevron, NYSE, CVX, However, comes, increasing, dividends, Exxon, stands, apart, pack, It, shown, commitment, rewarding, shareholders, oil, major, match, 
To, put, number, Exxon, increased, dividend, 34, I, highlighted, Chevron, oil, major, comes, close, Exxon, 29, streak, While, impressive, Exxon, longer, run, But, story, 
Chevron, actually, kept, dividend, static, 10, consecutive, quarters, oil, downturn, started, 2014, That, two, half, without, hike, The, annual, streak, stayed, alive, Chevron, history, increasing, dividend, middle, timing, thing, Exxon, meanwhile, increased, dividend, downturn, It, shows, vastly, different, level, commitment, shareholders, 
That, reason, like, dividend, brings, us, item, No, 4, list, Right, Exxon, yield, toward, high, end, historical, range, This, rough, gauge, valuation, suggesting, Exxon, trading, cheaply, relative, history, Put, another, way, could, good, time, buy, stock, 
XOM, Dividend, Yield, TTM, data, YCharts, 
However, cheap, price, good, deal, company, edge, financially, Luckily, Exxon, nowhere, near, financial, precipice, In, fact, one, best, financed, oil, majors, around, 
True, like, peers, Exxon, used, debt, fund, dividend, capital, spending, downturn, cash, flow, tight, That, clearly, desirable, However, even, one, deepest, oil, reversals, recent, history, Exxon, long, term, debt, roughly, 25, billion, June, 30, 2017, makes, less, 15, capital, structure, And, also, mid, point, 2017, around, 4, billion, cash, floating, around, Exxon, still, rock, solid, financial, condition, 
So, Exxon, financially, strong, great, also, one, best, run, oil, majors, around, It, really, items, five, six, together, make, difference, The, easiest, way, see, well, management, runs, Exxon, look, return, invested, capital, effectively, examines, effective, management, investing, shareholders, money, Exxon, historically, among, top, performers, industry, metric, Enough, said, 
XOM, Return, Invested, Capital, TTM, data, YCharts, 
We, covered, everything, future, oil, Exxon, financial, condition, operating, results, One, last, point, worth, looking, change, taking, place, today, In, ways, mixed, picture, helps, explain, relatively, high, yield, noted, But, get, caught, supposed, bad, news, 
On, negative, side, ledger, longtime, CEO, recently, left, company, take, prominent, place, President, Donald, Trump, cabinet, That, means, new, CEO, taking, reins, always, risk, But, company, man, steeped, Exxon, way, big, problem, 
Exxon, also, materially, reduced, oil, reserves, low, oil, prices, trimming, nearly, 20, total, early, 2017, That, unusual, step, conservatively, run, company, important, note, cut, came, Canadian, Oil, sands, investments, It, still, operating, business, oil, prices, go, enough, reserves, quickly, added, back, total, The, cut, driven, SEC, guidelines, case, backward, looking, consider, importance, oil, sands, future, global, oil, equation, Over, long, term, likely, much, ado, nothing, 
On, positive, side, meanwhile, Exxon, recently, bought, natural, gas, focused, InterOil, completed, deal, materially, expand, reach, onshore, U, S, drilling, Without, getting, much, detail, investments, appear, opportunistically, timed, energy, prices, still, relatively, low, expand, company, business, key, areas, These, appear, types, moves, want, see, company, make, And, large, cause, financial, strain, 
To, sum, point, bad, news, surrounding, Exxon, making, really, big, headlines, full, story, nearly, bad, negative, press, seems, suggest, Good, things, still, taking, place, bad, things, necessarily, bad, seem, Through, Exxon, working, solidly, toward, future, 
I, think, pretty, clear, I, believe, Exxon, good, story, today, In, fact, I, like, story, much, I, stock, However, good, company, always, good, investment, price, matters, key, It, good, company, I, noted, point, No, 4, looks, like, trading, decent, price, Exxon, kind, company, could, buy, today, never, sell, There, negatives, air, today, brought, long, term, opportunity,
