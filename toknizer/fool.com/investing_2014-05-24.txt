Some, best, opportunities, oil, gas, producing, companies, found, Arctic, This, partly, due, sheer, quantity, resources, found, area, By, estimates, Arctic, regions, world, contain, approximately, 400, billion, barrels, oil, equivalent, roughly, 13, undiscovered, oil, 30, undiscovered, natural, gas, world, As, may, good, idea, investors, take, look, companies, attempting, develop, area, One, company, ExxonMobil, NYSE, XOM, 
Kara, Sea, Exploration, Project, 
One, ExxonMobil, projects, Arctic, Kara, Sea, Exploration, Project, joint, venture, Russia, Rosneft, This, project, nearing, stage, companies, begin, exploration, drilling, could, potentially, pay, big, ExxonMobil, Rosneft, This, due, size, prospect, geological, surveys, revealed, This, prospect, named, Universitetskaya, larger, city, Moscow, could, contain, nine, billion, barrels, oil, This, would, make, one, largest, discoveries, recent, indeed, contain, much, oil, means, certain, 
Unfortunately, Arctic, regions, tend, extremely, expensive, drill, operate, due, largely, challenges, presented, harsh, weather, conditions, found, area, For, reason, exploration, well, ExxonMobil, intends, drill, Universitetskaya, formation, later, one, expensive, company, ever, drilled, The, company, expects, cost, nearly, 600, million, drill, well, However, resources, discovered, anywhere, close, estimated, potential, prove, profitable, project, ExxonMobil, long, run, 
Canadian, Beaufort, Sea, 
Another, Arctic, project, run, affiliate, ExxonMobil, Imperial, Oil, NYSEMKT, IMO, news, recently, due, company, ambitious, plan, drill, deepest, Arctic, offshore, well, ever, attempt, discover, oil, Forbes, states, well, approximately, 24, 000, feet, deep, sources, state, well, 34, 000, feet, deep, Regardless, extremely, ambitious, project, quite, effectively, illustrates, challenges, companies, ExxonMobil, go, attempt, develop, last, great, frontier, oil, 
One, reasons, project, challenging, environmental, conditions, Beaufort, Sea, This, sea, located, northeastern, coast, Alaska, contains, numerous, icebergs, roughly, nine, Thus, company, drill, approximately, three, long, period, summer, risk, iceberg, hitting, drilling, rig, otherwise, disrupting, operations, much, lower, Because, take, Imperial, Oil, around, three, drill, exploration, well, instead, less, one, would, normally, take, This, means, cost, much, take, longer, otherwise, would, Imperial, Oil, extension, ExxonMobil, realize, profits, project, 
However, profits, come, could, tremendous, According, David, Ramsey, Minister, Industry, Tourism, Investment, Canada, Northwest, Territories, resource, potential, Beaufort, Sea, could, rival, Gulf, Mexico, one, hotspots, offshore, development, recent, Robert, Peabody, COO, Husky, Energy, seconded, statement, stating, resources, indeed, difficult, access, Therefore, definitely, project, could, pay, ExxonMobil, 
Other, companies, active, Arctic, 
ExxonMobil, company, actively, engaged, developing, Arctic, For, example, BP, NYSE, BP, 50, stake, Beaufort, Sea, project, discussed, Imperial, Oil, ExxonMobil, combination, 50, Royal, Dutch, Shell, NYSE, RDS, A, actively, attempting, develop, various, areas, nearby, Chukchi, Sea, Shell, expects, drill, several, exploration, wells, Sea, 
Ultimately, Arctic, operations, companies, could, prove, highly, profitable, despite, many, challenges, safely, operating, area, This, due, enormous, resource, potential, region, resources, could, useful, satiating, world, growing, hunger, fossil, fuels,
